# Introduction
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.

Unfortunately, the data delivery contains little metadata, so it takes some
effort to understand the data format and analyze it correctly. Among other
problems, we need to understand dates and locations of samples, what analytes
were used for different samples, etc.

In this notebook we look at sample replication and duplication.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(htmltools)  # used by knitr; called only to avoid startup text later
library(knitr)
```
# Load Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
fn <- 'CascoBaySWATtissue_Bohlen.xlsx'
```

## Copy Data
This is a larger data file that takes some time to load.  Getting the column
types right dramatically improves load speed. Much of the data is qualitative,
and can't be handled in R.
```{r copy_data}
SWAT_data <- read_excel(file.path(sibling, fn), 
    sheet = "Mussels Data", col_types = c("numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text"))

before <- nrow(SWAT_data)
```

## Remove Duplicates
Many samples -- nearly 20% -- are members of a group of duplicates.  We can
think of no valid reason why two records should be exact duplicates in this
setting, so we remove all duplicates using the unique() function.

```{r remove_duplicates}
SWAT_data <- unique(SWAT_data)
```

## Simplify the Data and Add Unique Sample Codes
This logic was developed in "SWAT_data examination_UNIQUE.Rmd".
```{r}
SWAT_simplified <- SWAT_data %>%
  # Eliminate uninformative identifiers
  select    (-`SAMPLE TYPE`, -`SAMPLE POINT TYPE`, -`SAMPLE LOCATION`,
             -`RESULT TYPE`, -`PARAMETER_QUALIFIER`, -`PARAMETER FILTERED`,
             -`SAMPLE FILTER`, -`DEPTH`, -`DEPTH UNITS`,
             -TREATMENT, -`METER_CALIBRATED`) %>%
  
  # Eliminate data we will not analyze
  select    (-SITE_DESCRIPTION, -ANALYSIS_DATE,
             -`QC TYPE`, -SAMPLED_BY, -`UNITS DESCRIPTION`,
             -`SAMPLE COMMENT`, -`LAB COMMENT`, -`VALIDATION COMMENT`) %>%
  
  # Create Site Code and Site Name
  mutate    (SiteCode =  first(sub('.* - ','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`)), 
             Site =  first(sub(' - .*','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`))) %>%
  select(-EGAD_SITE_NAME) %>%
  
  # Create Year Time Stamp and (Draft 1) Unique Sample ID
  mutate    (Year  = as.numeric(format(SAMPLE_DATE, '%Y')),
             sample_id = gsub(" ", "_", SAMPLE_ID)) %>%
  group_by  (Year) %>%
  mutate    (tag = as.numeric(factor(SAMPLE_DATE))) %>%
  ungroup   ()  %>%
  mutate    (Code = paste(sample_id, Year, tag, sep = '_')) %>%
  select    (-sample_id, -tag) %>%
  select(`SITE SEQ`, SiteCode, Site, Year, SAMPLE_DATE,
         SAMPLE_ID, Code, everything())
SWAT_simplified
```

Now that we have designations for single sampling events (locations / dates /
replicates) we can ask whether we get either duplicate data entries or
replicates.

# Check for Duplicates
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(c(`SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, SiteCode, CURRENT_SAMPLE_POINT_NAME,
           Code, PARAMETER, `WEIGHT BASIS`, CONCENTRATION)) %>%
  group_by(`SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, Code, PARAMETER, `WEIGHT BASIS`) %>%
  summarize(nvals     = n(),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(nvals > 1) %>%
  nrow()
```
We have duplicate values for quite a few combinations of samples and parameters.
That is a surprise, since we pulled out complete replicates already.  (Some of
these are data where values of CONCENTRATION are NA.)

## Why Does Duplication or Replication Occur?
### Identical Samples Sometimes Reported From Different Laboratories
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>% 
  filter(Code == 'CBBBBB_REP_1_2006_4', PARAMETER == "2,4'-DDD" |
           PARAMETER == "2,4'-DDE" | PARAMETER == "2,4'-DDT")
```
So, duplication arose here because of designation to different analysis labs.
Some samples are allocated to "AXYS ANALYTIC SERVICES", and some to "PACE
ANALYTICAL", but data are otherwise identical, which is unlikely.  These are
probably errors of some sort.

#### How Many of These Cases Are There?
The following selects distinct values WITH the analysis lab info included. It
then groups rows without the analysis lab information and looks for groups with
more than one  value.  What it should collect are rows that differ only by
ANALYSIS LAB.
```{r}
tmp <- SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, SiteCode, `SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, PARAMETER,
         `ANALYSIS LAB`, `ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID`,
          CONCENTRATION, `WEIGHT BASIS`) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(`SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE,
           Code, PARAMETER, `WEIGHT BASIS`,
           CONCENTRATION) %>%
  summarize(nvals   = n(),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(nvals > 1)
nrow(tmp)
```

```{r}
tmp
rm(tmp) 
```

###  MOISTURE and LIPIDS Are Often Duplicates
Lets separate out by lab, and consider how many duplicates we STILL get
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>% select(Code, `SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, PARAMETER,
                           `ANALYSIS LAB`, `ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID`,
                           CONCENTRATION, `WEIGHT BASIS`) %>%
  filter(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  group_by(`SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, Code, `ANALYSIS LAB`, PARAMETER) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            m = mean(CONCENTRATION, na.rm=TRUE),
            d = max(CONCENTRATION) - min(CONCENTRATION),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(n>1 & d==0) %>%
  nrow()
```

So, even separated by analysis lab, we see just over 80 duplicate values.
To figure out why, we need to look at the original data again.
```{r}
SWAT_data %>%
  filter(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  group_by(`SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, SAMPLE_ID, PARAMETER, `ANALYSIS LAB` ) %>%
  mutate(n = n(),
         m = mean(CONCENTRATION, na.rm=TRUE),
         d = max(CONCENTRATION) - min(CONCENTRATION)) %>%
  filter(n>1 & d==0)
```
These are all either LIPID or MOISTURE values, expressed in percent. They differ
principally (only?) in the test method they are associated with, and sometimes
in a parameter qualifier.  We believe that is because these percent values are
collected once per sample, but reported with each analytic data series.  We can
eliminate this apparent parameter duplication.

### Remove Lipid and Moisture Observations
THis code is just to count duplicates.  To actually assemble data we would
want to drop all but the first observation in each group.
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>% select(Code, `SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, PARAMETER,
                           `ANALYSIS LAB`, `ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID`,
                           CONCENTRATION, `WEIGHT BASIS`) %>%
  filter(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  filter(PARAMETER != "LIPIDS" & PARAMETER != "MOISTURE") %>%
  group_by(`SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, Code, `ANALYSIS LAB`, PARAMETER) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            m = mean(CONCENTRATION, na.rm=TRUE),
            d = max(CONCENTRATION) - min(CONCENTRATION),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(n>1 & d==0)
```
So there is only one "unexplained" duplicate.  Lets check to see why it
occurred.

## Single Remaining "Unexplained" Duplicate.
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>% 
  filter(Code == 'CBGDSW_REP_2_2003_4', PARAMETER == "MERCURY")
```
The two values are assigned to different analytic methods -- also unlikely to
produce identical values, so likely an inadvertent duplication.


# Remove Duplicate Samples
```{r}
# Step 1:  Remove extra MERCURY Sample

SWAT_final <- SWAT_simplified %>%
  filter (! (Code == 'CBGDSW_REP_2_2003_4' &
               PARAMETER == "MERCURY" &
               `TEST METHOD` == "SW6020")) %>%

# Step 2:  Remove duplicate MOISTURE and LIPIDS values
# the logic here is that the "test" is unique for all rows
# EXCEPT those we might wand to remove, so we protect all
# other rows from being removed by "distinct".
  mutate(test = if_else(PARAMETER=='MOISTURE' | PARAMETER == 'LIPIDS',
                        0L , row_number())) %>%
  distinct(.keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  select  (-test) %>%
  
# Step 3:  Remove samples that differ only in the associated laboratory
  distinct(across(-`ANALYSIS LAB`), .keep_all = TRUE)
  
```

## Test If That Worked
```{r}
SWAT_final %>% select(Code, `SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, PARAMETER,
                           `ANALYSIS LAB`, `ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID`,
                           CONCENTRATION, `WEIGHT BASIS`) %>%
  filter(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  filter(PARAMETER != "LIPIDS" & PARAMETER != "MOISTURE") %>%
  group_by(`SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, Code, `ANALYSIS LAB`, PARAMETER) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            m = mean(CONCENTRATION, na.rm=TRUE),
            d = max(CONCENTRATION) - min(CONCENTRATION),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(n>1 & d==0)
```
So, we apparently have no remaining quantitative duplicates!

```{r}
SWAT_final %>% nrow()
sum(duplicated(SWAT_final))
```

# Replicates

## All Replicates
We do find laboratory replicates in the data. They are distinguished by
different `ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID`,
```{r}
SWAT_final %>% select(Code, `SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, PARAMETER,
                      `ANALYSIS LAB`, `ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID`,
                      `TEST METHOD`, CONCENTRATION, `WEIGHT BASIS`) %>%
  filter(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  group_by(`SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, Code, PARAMETER, `ANALYSIS LAB`) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            m = mean(CONCENTRATION, na.rm=TRUE),
            d = max(CONCENTRATION) - min(CONCENTRATION),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(n>1 & d>0) %>%
  nrow()
```
## Those That Are NOT Different Laboratory Samples
```{r}
tmp <- SWAT_final %>% select(Code, `SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, PARAMETER,
                      `ANALYSIS LAB`, `ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID`,
                      `TEST METHOD`, CONCENTRATION, `WEIGHT BASIS`) %>%
  filter(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  group_by(`SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, Code, PARAMETER,
           `ANALYSIS LAB`, `ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID`) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            m = mean(CONCENTRATION, na.rm=TRUE),
            d = max(CONCENTRATION) - min(CONCENTRATION),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(n>1 & d>0)
nrow(tmp)
```

## The Remaining Non-duplicate Values Are All `WEIGHT`
We define a replicate as a separate observation that occurs on data collected
at the same site and date.  Replication can occur in the field or in the
laboratory.  Replicates in the Field are usually identified in the SAMPLE
indicators.  Laboratory duplicated are indicated by different lab sample
numbers.

We can search for entries where with all the sample and lab analysis ID
information included, we still get more than one sample. These are NOT
replicates, and need to be addressed.
 
```{r}
tmp
rm(tmp)
```
We have a small number of entries with multiple values even from single labs and
single lab sample IDs, but they are all WEIGHT.

We won't need to deal with WEIGHT data at all, since we are working with data
already converted to dry weight or lipid weight basis.

It appears the WEIGHT in these cases is based on a subsample of bulk tissue
samples destined for different analytic methods.   We see that in this next
block of code, which adds the laboratory method designation to the grouping
structure, and it eliminates  remaining replication.

These values carry no information about field conditions, and thus are of no
interest to us.  Since we will not analyze these values, we need not remove them
from the data.
 
## Can We Account for All Replicates?
```{r}
SWAT_final %>% select(Code, `SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, PARAMETER,
                      `ANALYSIS LAB`, `ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID`,
                      `TEST METHOD`, CONCENTRATION, `WEIGHT BASIS`) %>%
  filter(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  group_by(`SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, Code, PARAMETER, 
           `ANALYSIS LAB`,`ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID`,`TEST METHOD`) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            m = mean(CONCENTRATION, na.rm=TRUE),
            d = max(CONCENTRATION) - min(CONCENTRATION),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(n>1 & d>0)
```
