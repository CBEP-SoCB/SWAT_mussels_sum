# Introduction
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.

Unfortunately, the data delivery contains little metadata, so it takes some
effort to understand the data format and analyze it correctly. Among other
problems, we need to understand dates and locations of samples, what analytes
were used for different samples, etc.

In this notebook and accompanying notebooks, we take various slices through the
data to understand its structure.

This Notebook generates the following derived data files:

sample_spatial.csv
sites_spatial.csv


# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(htmltools)  # used by knitr called here only to avoid startup text later in document
library(knitr)

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()
theme_set

library(LCensMeans)
```
# Load Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
fn <- 'CascoBaySWATtissue_Bohlen.xlsx'
```

## Copy Data
This is a larger data file that takes some time to load.  Getting the column
types right dramatically improves load speed. Much of the data is qualitative,
and can't be handled in R.
```{r}
SWAT_data <- read_excel(file.path(sibling, fn), 
    sheet = "Mussels Data", col_types = c("numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text"))

before <- nrow(SWAT_data)
```

## Remove duplicates
Many samples -- nearly 20% -- are members of a group of duplicates.  We can
think of no valid reason why two records should be exact duplicates in this
setting, so we remove all duplicates using the unique() function.

```{r}
SWAT_data <- unique(SWAT_data)
```

# Sites
## List of Sites
Note that we pull apart the site name into a site code and a longer name.
```{r}
sites <- SWAT_data %>%
  select(`SITE SEQ`, `EGAD_SITE_NAME`) %>%
  group_by(`SITE SEQ`, `EGAD_SITE_NAME`) %>%
  summarize(SiteCode =  first(sub('.* - ','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`)), 
            Site =  first(sub(' - .*','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`)),
                        .groups = 'drop') %>%
  select(-`EGAD_SITE_NAME`)
#write_csv(sites, 'cb_SWAT_sites_list.csv')
kable(sites)
```

We can check that the results are unique:
```{r}
any(duplicated(sites$`SITE SEQ`))
any(duplicated(sites$SiteCode))
any(duplicated(sites$Site))
```

## Match Sites with Geographic Locations
In addition to the toxics data, we received a separate Excel file containing
geospatial data.  That data includes repeat geographic data for each site,
apparently providing more information on separate sample collection events.  As
far as we have been able to tell, however, there is no consistent sample
identifier between the geographic data and toxics data as received.

Here we reduce the spatial data to data on each nominal sampling location, and
check that we have geographic data for each site.  As is often the case, we lack
precise metadata on geographic coordinates. We do know locations were collected
in most cases with hand-held GPS units, which suggests lat-long data are
probably in WGS 1984.

We will need to return to the spatial data later to see whether sampling events
have slightly different nominal sampling locations from their reported sites.

```{r}
fn <- 'CascoBay_SWAT_Spatial.xlsx'
samples_spatial_data <- read_excel(file.path(sibling, fn))%>%
  mutate(`SITE UTM X` = as.numeric(`SITE UTM X`),
         `SITE UTM Y` = as.numeric(`SITE UTM Y`),
         `SITE LATITUDE` = as.numeric(`SITE LATITUDE`),
         `SITE LONGITUDE` = as.numeric(`SITE LONGITUDE`),
         `SAMPLE POINT UTM X` = as.numeric(`SAMPLE POINT UTM X`),
         `SAMPLE POINT UTM Y` = as.numeric(`SAMPLE POINT UTM Y`),
         `SAMPLE POINT LATITUDE` = as.numeric(`SAMPLE POINT LATITUDE`),
         `SAMPLE POINT LONGITUDE` = as.numeric(`SAMPLE POINT LONGITUDE`),
  )

sites_spatial_data <- samples_spatial_data  %>%
  rename(SITESEQ = `SITE SEQ`) %>%
    group_by(SITESEQ) %>%
    summarize(SITECODE  = first(sites$SiteCode[match(SITESEQ, sites$`SITE SEQ`)]),
              SITE  = first(sites$Site[match(SITESEQ, sites$`SITE SEQ`)]),
              UTM_E = first(`SITE UTM X`),
              UTM_N = first(`SITE UTM Y`),
              LAT   = first(`SITE LATITUDE`),
              LONG  = first(`SITE LONGITUDE`),
              .groups = 'drop') 
kable(sites_spatial_data)
#rm(sites)
```

```{r}
sum(! is.na(sites_spatial_data$SITE))
```
So, they're all there. Presumably the other sites have samples of other
shellfish (in the second tab of the source Excel File).

## Write CSV file for GIS
```{r}
write_csv(sites_spatial_data, 'sites_spatial.csv')
```

ArcGIS was having trouble reading earlier drafts of the following file, so we
simplify here by removing spaces from column names and removing NAs.
Without this step, NAs were forcing ArcGIS to interpret data columns as
text.
```{r} 
samples_spatial_data %>%
  select ( -`SITE UTM X`, -`SITE UTM Y`, -`SITE LATITUDE`, -`SITE LONGITUDE`,
           - DATA_SOURCE, -LOCATION_ACCURACY, -LOCATION_METHOD) %>%
  rename_all(~gsub(' ', '', .)) %>%
  write_csv('samples_spatial.csv', na = '')
```

# Sample Points
Many Sites have more than one SAMPLE POINTs.  The SAMPLE POINTs appear
to be the real sampling locations, each associated with a nominal SITE.
Unfortunately, recording of actual sampling locations may have been inconsistent
with real (i.e., not identical) SAMPLE POINT data not available from earlier
sample years.

## Examine Distances between Site and Sample Points
```{r}
a <- samples_spatial_data %>%
  select(`SITE SEQ`, CURRENT_SITE_NAME, `SITE UTM X`, `SITE UTM Y`,
         `SAMPLE POINT NAME`, `SAMPLE POINT SEQ`,
         `SAMPLE POINT UTM X`,`SAMPLE POINT UTM Y`) %>%
  mutate(SiteCode =  sub('.* - ','', `CURRENT_SITE_NAME`)) %>%
  mutate(d = sqrt((`SAMPLE POINT UTM X` -`SITE UTM X`)^2 + 
                  (`SAMPLE POINT UTM Y` -`SITE UTM Y`)^2)) %>%
  group_by(`SiteCode`) %>%
  summarize(sitex    = first(`SITE UTM X`),
            sitey    = first(`SITE UTM Y`),
            maxx    = round(max(abs(`SAMPLE POINT UTM X` - `SITE UTM X`)),2),
            maxy    = round(max(abs(`SAMPLE POINT UTM Y` - `SITE UTM Y`)),2),
            maxd    = round(max(d), 2),
            n = n(),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  select(-sitex, -sitey)
kable(a, col.names = c('Site', 'Max X Distance', 'Max Y Distance', 'Maximum Distance From Site', 'N'))
```
## Map Visualization
Several  Sites show (unreasonable?) large differences between Sample Points
and nominal Site locations.  To make sense of this, we mapped Sites and 
Sample Points in Arc GIS.
! [Map of SWAT Sampling Locations and Nominal Sites](SWAT_Toxics_Locations.jpg)
The map shows clearly that sites represent general areas, not the exact
locations where samples were collected. IN most cases, the distances are trivial
on a map of this scale, but not always.

*  **CBBBBB -- Back Bay**:  Do not appear to be typos, but exact locations do
  not appear to have been collected in all years.  Samples appearto have ben
   collected from various locations along the Back Bay Shoreline. identical for all
   samples.  Locations in Samples in 2015 all fairly consistent, but differ
   slightly.
*  **CBHWNP -- Harpswell Navy Pier**:  Multiple samples from each of two years,
   were given identical GPS coordinates.  The two locations are some distance
   apart.  
*  **CBMBBR  -- Brunswick Mare Brook**:  States positions from 2015 only
   accurate to 1000m. but they look better. Sampling Points are spread out along
   the shoreline and the nominal Site location is not all that close to most of
   them, but is located bayward of them.
*  **CBPRES -- Presumpscot River East** -- Sample Points along shore, East shore.  
*  **CBPRWS -- Presumpscot River West** -- Sample Points along shore, West shore.  
*  **CBPRM -- Presumpscot River Mouth** -- Sample Points along shore, BOTH shores.
