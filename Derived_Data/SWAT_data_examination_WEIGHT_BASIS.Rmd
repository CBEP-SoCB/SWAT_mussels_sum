# Introduction
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.  

In this notebook, we conduct a basic data quality aSSUrance check, looking to
determine whether values expressed on a wet weight, dry weight, and lipid weight
basis make sense.

*   DRY and LIPID based values are derived from wet weight
    values, and so should be both no more numerous.  
*   Lipid weight is a fraction of dry weight, concentrations expressed on a
    lipid weight basis should always be greater than values expressed on a dry
    weight basis, which should likewise exceed values expressed on a wet weight
    basis.  

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(htmltools)  # used by knitr called here  to avoid startup text later
library(knitr)

library(CBEPgraphics)

library(LCensMeans)
```

# Load Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
fn <- 'CascoBaySWATtissue_Bohlen.xlsx'
```

## Copy Data
This is a larger data file that takes some time to load.  Getting the column
types right dramatically improves load speed. Much of the data is qualitative,
and can't be handled in R.
```{r}
SWAT_data <- read_excel(file.path(sibling, fn), 
    sheet = "Mussels Data", col_types = c("numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text"))

before <- nrow(SWAT_data)
```

## Remove duplicates
Many samples -- nearly 20% -- are members of a group of duplicates.  We can
think of no valid reason why two records should be exact duplicates in this
setting, so we remove all duplicates using the unique() function.

```{r}
SWAT_data <- unique(SWAT_data)
```

## Simplify Data and Add Unique Sample Codes
This logic was developed in "SWAT_data examination_UNIQUE.Rmd".
```{r}
SWAT_simplified <- SWAT_data %>%
  # Eliminate uninformative identifiers
  select    (-`SAMPLE TYPE`, -`SAMPLE POINT TYPE`, -`SAMPLE LOCATION`,
             -`RESULT TYPE`, -`PARAMETER_QUALIFIER`, -`PARAMETER FILTERED`,
             -`SAMPLE FILTER`, -`DEPTH`, -`DEPTH UNITS`,
             -TREATMENT, -`METER_CALIBRATED`) %>%
  
  # Eliminate data we will not analyze
  select    (-SITE_DESCRIPTION, -ANALYSIS_DATE,
             -`QC TYPE`, -SAMPLED_BY, -`UNITS DESCRIPTION`,
             -`SAMPLE COMMENT`, -`LAB COMMENT`, -`VALIDATION COMMENT`) %>%
  
  # Create Site Code and Site Name
  mutate    (SiteCode =  sub('.* - ','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`), 
             Site     =  sub(' - .*','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`)) %>%
  select    (-EGAD_SITE_NAME) %>%
  
  # Create Year Time Stamp and (Draft 1) Unique Sample ID
  mutate    (Year  = as.numeric(format(SAMPLE_DATE, '%Y')),
             sample_id = gsub(" ", "_", SAMPLE_ID)) %>%
  group_by  (Year) %>%
  mutate    (tag = as.numeric(factor(SAMPLE_DATE))) %>%
  ungroup   ()  %>%
  mutate    (Code = paste(sample_id, Year, tag, sep = '_')) %>%
  select    (-sample_id, -tag) %>%
  select    (`SITE SEQ`, SiteCode, Site, Year, SAMPLE_DATE,
              SAMPLE_ID, Code, everything())
SWAT_simplified
```



# Check That Number of LIP <= DRY <= WET
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, PARAMETER, `WEIGHT BASIS`, CONCENTRATION) %>%
  group_by(PARAMETER) %>%
  summarize(nlip = sum(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'LIP', na.rm= TRUE),
            ndry = sum(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'DRY', na.rm= TRUE),
            nwet = sum(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET', na.rm= TRUE),
            problem = ! (nlip<= ndry & ndry <= nwet),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
    filter(problem)
            
```
Two of those appear to be effectively attribution problems, since the parameters
apply to whole samples (e.g., percentage of lipids and total solids).

It's not clear what is going on with the metals. This appears to be the result
of samples where we have data on a DRY basis but not on a WET basis.

```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, PARAMETER, `WEIGHT BASIS`) %>%
  group_by(PARAMETER, Code) %>%
  summarize(nlip = sum(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'LIP', na.rm= TRUE),
            ndry = sum(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'DRY', na.rm= TRUE),
            nwet = sum(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET', na.rm= TRUE),
            problem = ! (ndry <= nwet),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
    filter(problem)
            
```
It appears that all data collected in 2006 lacks metals data on a wet weight
basis.  Other missing data is associated with the PARAMETER "SOLIDS-TOTAL
RESIDUE (TS)", where it makes no difference.

This does not need correction, since the missing data will automatically be left
out of any analysis we conduct.  If wet weight values were key for an analysis,
we might be able to back calculate them.

# Check That Value of LIP <= DRY <= WET
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, PARAMETER, `TEST METHOD`, `WEIGHT BASIS`, CONCENTRATION) %>%
  group_by(Code, PARAMETER) %>%
  summarize(method = first(`TEST METHOD`),
            vlip = mean(CONCENTRATION[`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'LIP'], na.rm= TRUE),
            vdry = mean(CONCENTRATION[`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'DRY'], na.rm= TRUE),
            vwet = mean(CONCENTRATION[`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET'], na.rm= TRUE),
            n = n(),
            problem = ! (vlip >= vdry & vdry >= vwet),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
      filter(problem)
```

The last six problems are all moisture values (where this is meaningless). The
others are all PCB values, apparently from one sampling event.  that suggests
some sort of transcription error or contamination problem in the lipid analysis.

Note that the PCB errors are either `TEST METHOD` "E1668A" or calculated PCB
values -- totals and TEQs.

```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, PARAMETER, `WEIGHT BASIS`, CONCENTRATION, `UNITS VALUE`) %>%
  filter(Code == "CBEEEE_REP_4_2009_5",
         grepl('LIPID|SOLID|MOISTURE', PARAMETER))

```

Shouldn't `SOLIDS-TOTAL RESIDUE` be equal to `1 - MOISTURE`?  It is odd that the
error is exactly 10%.  That suggests a typographical error. We can compare
results to the other replicates.
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, PARAMETER, CONCENTRATION, `WEIGHT BASIS`) %>%
  filter(grepl("CBEEEE_REP_._2009_5", Code),
         grepl('LIPID|SOLID|MOISTURE', PARAMETER)) %>%
  pivot_wider(Code, names_from = `WEIGHT BASIS`, values_from = CONCENTRATION)
```
So, for all of these EXCEPT `REP_4`, the expected identity nearly applies
(within one percent): $DRY \approx 1 - WET$.  And the WET value is about 83.4%.
This suggests a typographical or other error in the WET value for this sample.

# Hand Calculate Values for Comparison
We calculate values for one PARAMETER `2',3,4,4',5-PENTACHLOROBIPHENYL` by hand.
(From the first row of the results returned above).
```{r}
# Dry-Weight Basis
8.55/(1-0.903)
# Dry-weight basis calculated based on DRY value 
8.55/0.171
# Lipid basis calculated based on LIP value
8.55/0.014
```
The DRY basis (NEARLY) matches the value in the data.  The other two values
don't. We can conclude that:  
1. The "WET" `WEIGHT BASIS` values were calculated from the `MOISTURE` values.  
2. the `SOLIDS-TOTAL RESIDUE (TS)` was not used for calculations.  
2. The reported "LIPID" `WEIGHT BASIS` are off by a factor of ten.  

We can confirm that this sample has problems by comparing results with the
other' three FIELD replicate samples collected on the same site and day. As
these are FIELD replicates, we do not expect identical results, but in general,
results should be similar.

Here we focus only on one `PARAMETER`, but results are similar for all PCBs.
We include the `TEST METHOD` here because it appears all values associated with
this test method are suspect.
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, `SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, `TEST METHOD`, PARAMETER,
         CONCENTRATION, `WEIGHT BASIS`) %>%
  filter(grepl("CBEEEE_REP_._2009_5", Code),
         PARAMETER == '2-CHLOROBIPHENYL') %>%
  pivot_wider( names_from = `WEIGHT BASIS`, values_from = CONCENTRATION)
```
Compared to sample replicates:

1.  The error in the LIPID-based values appears to *underestimate*
    concentrations by a factor of ten.  That value could in principal be 
    recalculated based on (what appears to be) the correct LIPID value. 
    
2.  The DRY-based value is not obviously impossible, but it is roughly 1.75
    times the other replicates (as expected with the likely error in the
    `MOISTURE` values.  This error can *not* be corrected, since the `MOISTURE`
    value on which it is based is itself suspect.  

To be Safe, we should probably drop this sample from the PCB calculations if we
rely on either the LIPID or DRY WEIGHT values.

The Problem does not appear to extend to other organic contaminants.
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, `SITE SEQ`, SAMPLE_DATE, `TEST METHOD`, PARAMETER,
         CONCENTRATION, `WEIGHT BASIS`) %>%
  filter(grepl("CBEEEE_REP_._2009_5", Code),
         grepl('NAPHTHALENE|DDT', PARAMETER)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = `WEIGHT BASIS`, values_from = CONCENTRATION)
```

# Identify / Remove Suspect Values
We need to remove:  

1.  Data ONLY from sampling event `Code` = "CBEEEE_REP_4_2009_5"  
2.  PCB Data with `TEST METHOD` = "E1668A"  
3.  The four calculated PCB values based on those:  
    *  PCB TOTAL TEQ (ND=0)  
    *  PCB TOTAL TEQ (ND=1/2 DL)  
    *  PCB TOTAL TEQ (ND=DL)  
    *  PCBs  
4.  Remove BOTH `WEIGHT BASIS` = "DRY" and `WEIGHT BASIS` = "LIPID"
    for those samples.  

## The Suspect Values
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, PARAMETER, CONCENTRATION, `TEST METHOD`, `WEIGHT BASIS`) %>%
  filter(Code == "CBEEEE_REP_4_2009_5",
         `TEST METHOD` == "E1668A" | 
               PARAMETER == 'PCBS' |
               grepl('PCB TOTAL TEQ', PARAMETER),
         `WEIGHT BASIS` == 'LIP' | `WEIGHT BASIS` == 'DRY')
```

## A Single Logical Test Value
So, make that selection process a single test, so it is easier to negate.
```{r}
mytest <- with(SWAT_simplified, 
               Code == "CBEEEE_REP_4_2009_5" &
               (`TEST METHOD` == "E1668A" | 
                 PARAMETER == 'PCBS' |
                 grepl('PCB TOTAL TEQ', PARAMETER)) &
               (`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'LIP' | `WEIGHT BASIS` == 'DRY'))
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, PARAMETER, CONCENTRATION, `TEST METHOD`, `WEIGHT BASIS`) %>%
  filter(mytest)
```
