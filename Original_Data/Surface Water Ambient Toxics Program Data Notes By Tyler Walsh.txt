It looks like every year has data for 11 metals (Ag, Al, Ar, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Hg, Ni, Zn) from studies on blue mussels
and soft shell clams. However, the 2017/2018 study looked at Se instead of Zn, in soft shell clams. Every year has data
for PAHs & PCBs. All years have data for PFCs, except for 2012 and 2013, which has various pesticide data instead. Sites vary
throughout the years, and sampling PAHs/PCBs/PCFs/pesticides will sometimes be with both blue mussels and soft shell clams, and
sometimes one or the other -- depending on the year.

Data appears to be different than the Gulfwatch and the Mussel Watch Program data. According to the 2011 report,
data is compared to the Gulfwatch data.
