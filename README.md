Analysis of data on tissue concentrations of toxics from Maine's Surface Water
Ambient Toxics program.

# Statement of Purpose
CBEP is committed to the ideal of open science.  Our State of the Bay data
archives ensure the science underlying the 2020 State of the Bay report is
documented and reproducible by others. The purpose of these archives is to
release raw data and data analysis code whenever possible to allow others to
review, critique, learn from, and build upon CBEP science.

# Archive Structure
 CBEP 2020 State of the Bay data analysis repositories are divided into from two
 to four sub-folders.  All archives contain at least an "Original_Data" and a
 "Graphics" folder.  The other two folders are only included if strictly
 necessary.

Need to combine original and derived data folders since they are still separate 
- **Original Data**.  Original data, with a "DATA_SOURCES.md" or "READ ME.txt" file
that documents data sources.  
    **DATA IN THIS FOLDER IS AS ORIGINALLY PROVIDED OR ACCESSED.** 

- **Derived Data**.  Data derived from the original raw data.  Includes
documentation of data reorganization steps, either in the form of files (R
notebooks, Excel files, etc.) that embody data transformations, or via another
README.txt file.

- **Analysis**.  Contains one or more R Notebooks proceeding through the data
analysis steps.

- **Graphics**.  Contains R Notebooks stepping through development of related
graphics, and also raw copies of resulting graphics, usually in \*.png and
\*.pdf formats.  These graphics may differ from graphics as they appear in final
State of the Bay graphical layouts.

# Summary of Data Source

Data is derived from the EGAD database maintained by Maine's Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP)  Contents include tissue toxics samples from
location within Casco Bay.
