## Sample Data
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.

Most data were collected as part of Maine's "Surface Water Ambient Toxics"
program, known as "SWAT." The SWAT program (*inter alia*) samples tissue of
various marine shellfish for concentrations of selected persistent toxic
chemicals, including metals, PCBs, PAHs, and certain pesticides.  Ultimately,
the Excel file includes data derived from the definitive data found in Maine
DEP's EGAD database.

Working data files were derived from the data as provided, after considerable
QA/QC effort. Values have been filtered to avoid presenting the same data in 
multiple ways.  In particular, we present only a subset of calculated sample 
totals (sums of contaminants) contained in the original data.

## Geospatial Data
Geographic data on sampling locations was provided separately to CBEP by Maine 
DEP.  It provides geographic data (latitudes and longitudes) associated with 
specific sampling locations.
