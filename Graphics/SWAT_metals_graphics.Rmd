# Introduction
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.

In this Notebook, we analyze metal contaminants found in blue mussel (*Mytilus
edulis*) tissue.  To simplify presentation, we focus on two questions:
Do recent samples exceed screening values, and do any metals show a trend in
levels?

DEP staff pointed us towards the detailed documentation in the 2017-2018 SWAT
data report.

>   Maine Department of Environmental Protection.  2019.  Surface Water Ambient
    Toxics Monitoring Program.  2017-2018 Report to the Joint Committee on
    Environmental and Natural Resources.  129th Legislature, First Session.
    
Much of the following analysis is based on that information.

## Handling Non-Detects
A "Non-Detect" is a sample where the concentration of a specific contaminant is
below the level where the laboratory methods are able to reliably detect the 
contaminant against background interference, measurement error, and instrument
limitations.  Statistically, a "non-detect" is a "left censored" observation. We
know the observation falls below the reporting limit, but we don't know by how
much.

Leaving non-detects out of analyses entirely biases results, because the lowest
observations (the non-detects) are omitted from analysis.  So it is generally
necessary to adopt statistical methods or some other convention for handling
non-detects.

While more sophisticated modeling approaches are available, CBEP's preference
for addressing non-detects is to replace non-detects before conducting analyses 
with an alternate value.  The question then becomes, what value should be used
to replace the (unobserved) non-detect?

CBEP's preference is to use (statistically-based) estimates of what one
would expect to have observed, if laboratory methods were better.
Specifically, for the 2020 State of Casco Bay Report, CBEP prefers to replace
non-detects with maximum likelihood estimates of the expected value of the
(unobserved) censored observations.

However, we have not done that for these analyses.  We prefer to treat
non-detects from any single data source consistently, and we could not use our
preferred convention for addressing non-detects for organic contaminants from
the SWAT data.  Because of differences in reporting of PAHs from year to year,
we were unable to recalculate PAH totals from the raw observations, and instead
have relied on calculations conducted by Maine DEP.  DEP provides results using
three different conventions: replace non-detects with, respectively, zero, 
half the reporting limit, or the reporting limit.

Here, we follow their convention of conducting analyses based on replacing
non-detects with one half of the Reporting Limit.

For metals in these samples, non-detects are relatively rare, and detection
limits are well below observed levels, so choice of the non-detect convention
should have little effect on the qualitative results of these analyses.

# Utility Functions
## Capitalise Strings
`This`convert_caps()` splits a string, capitalizes the first character and
uncaps the rest.  FOr one word strings, this correspondes to "title case".
```{r utility_fxn_capitalize}
simpleCap <- function(x) {
  s <- strsplit(x, " ")[[1]]
  paste(toupper(substring(s, 1,1)), tolower(substring(s, 2)),
      sep="", collapse=" ")
}

convert_caps <- function(x_vec) {
  as_vector(lapply(x_vec, simpleCap))
}

```

# Load Data
## Establish Folder References
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Derived_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
fn <- 'SWAT_metals_working.csv'

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

## Copy Data
Getting the column types right improves load speed. Much of the
data is qualitative, and can't be readily handled in R, so we delete it. To save
on keystrokes, we also clean up the parameter names.

```{r copy_data}
swat_metals <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn),
                        col_types = cols(
                          .default = col_character(),
                          site_seq = col_double(),
                          year = col_double(),
                          sample_date = col_date(format = ""),
                          concentration = col_double(),
                          rl = col_double(),
                          mdl = col_double(),
                          dilution_factor = col_double(),
                          cas_no = col_double(),
                          conc_ugg = col_double(),
                          rl_ugg = col_double(),
                          flag = col_logical(),
                          conc_RL = col_double(),
                          conc_HALF = col_double(),
                          conc_ML = col_double()
                        )) %>%
  select(-site_seq, -lab, -method, -method_name,
         -prep_method, -dilution_factor, -cas_no) %>%
  mutate(parameter = convert_caps(parameter))
```

## Load Reference Values
There are few really good ways to establish toxicity benchmarks for edible
tissue.  Maine DEP principally compares values of analytic totals to prevalence
benchmarks (medians and 85th percentiles) derived from the Gulfwatch and
National Status And trends monitoring programs, as published by Leblanc et al.
2009.

> Leblanc, L.A., Krahforst, C.F., AubÃ©, J., Roach, S., Brun, G., Harding, G.,
  Hennigar, P., Page, D., Jones, S., Shaw, S., Stahlnecker, J., Schwartz, J.,
  Taylor, D., Thorpe, B., & Wells, P. (2009).  Eighteenth Year of the Gulf of
  Maine Environmental Monitoring Program.

We copied benchmark tables from (an on-line version of) Leblanc et al. 2009 into
our excel spreadsheet.

That document refers to "MCDC Fish Tissue Action Levels." and FDA Action Levels.
After some digging, we found a document on the Maine CDC website that
corresponds to (most or all of) the FTALs reported by DEP.

**ALL HEALTH_RELATED THRESHOLDS ARE EXPRESSED ON A WET WEIGHT BASIS**

>  Maine Center for Disease Control. 2001.  Bureau of Health Fish Tissue Action Levels. 
   https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/environmental-health/eohp/fish/documents/action-levels-writeup.pdf. 
   Accessed 11/10/2020.

```{r load_ref_values}
references <- read_excel(file.path(sibling,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
                             sheet = "Metals Comparisons") %>%
  filter(! is.na(Reference_ugg)) %>%
  mutate(Reference_ugg = sub(' 2008', '', Reference_ugg))
```
We will use only two of the reference values:  
*  "NS&T 85th Percentile"  
*  "Gulfwatch 85th Percentile"  

The Health-based metrics are valuable for comparison, but they are expressed
on a wet weight basis, and so can not be shown on one graph with the other
reference levels.

We add shorter names for graphics
```{r add_short_ref_names}
references <- references %>%
  mutate(short_ref = case_when(
      Reference_ugg == 'NS&T 85th Percentile'       ~ 'National',
      Reference_ugg == 'Gulfwatch 85th Percentile'  ~ 'Gulf of Maine'
  ))
```

### Pivot Most Important References to Long Form
The long form annotation data allows us to add annotations to faceted plots in a
simple way.  While we are at it, we create better names for some reference
thresholds.
```{r long_form_refs}
ref_long <- references %>%
  filter(grepl('85', Reference_ugg)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = Silver:Zinc, names_to = 'parameter', values_to = 'value')
```

## Load Location Information
And add a short location names for figures.
```{r location_info}
locations <- read_csv(file.path(sibling,"sites_spatial.csv"), 
    col_types = cols(SITESEQ = col_skip(), 
        LAT = col_skip(), LONG = col_skip())) %>%

  mutate(short_locs= c("Back Bay",
                      "Outer Fore River",
                      "Cocktail Cove",
                      "SW Great Diamond",
                      "Navy Pier",
                      "Mill Creek",
                      "Royal River",
                      "Haraseeket",
                      "Falmouth",
                      "Mare Brook",
                      "Fore River",
                      "East End",
                      "Spring Point",
                      "Jewel Island",
                      "Presumpscot",
                      "Middle Bay",
                      "Maquoit Bay",
                      "Inner Fore",
                      "Quahog Bay",
                      "Long Island"))
  
swat_metals <- swat_metals %>%
  mutate(short_locs = locations$short_locs[match(sitecode,
                                                 locations$SITECODE)]) %>%
  mutate(short_locs = factor(short_locs,
                             levels = c('Navy Pier', 'Mare Brook', 'Mill Creek',
                                        'East End', 'Spring Point')))
rm(locations)
```

# Data Since 2010
Give the paucity of data and sited from 2015 through 2019, we consider "recent"
data to include the last 10 years, or 2010 through 2019.
```{r recent_data}
recent_data <- swat_metals %>%
  filter(year >= 2010)
```

## Results Table
We pull results of linear models and robust linear models developed in the file
'SWAT_metals_analysis.Rmd' in the Analysis Folder.  There, we looked at log 
linear models, robust linear models, and factorial models looking at slopes at
each of the  three long-term sites.  We draw conclusions based on careful
evaluation of all models, after considering whether data are suitable for
different models.

The following table summarizes results of those models.
(The following was transcribed by hand, which is error-prone, and won't update
automatically).
```{r results_table}
trends_table <- tribble(
~Symbol, ~Element, ~`Linear Trend`, ~`Kendalls TAU`, ~ `Step Trend`,
'Ag', 'Silver',   'Declining', 'No Trend',   'Declining at Spring Point*',
'Al', 'Aluminum', 'No Trend',  'No Trend**', 'No Trend',
'As', 'Arsenic',  'No Trend',  'Increasing', 'Increasing',
'Cd', 'Cadmium',  'No Trend',  'No Trend',   'No Trend',
'Cr', 'Chromium', 'Declining', 'Declining',  'Declining at East End and Spring Point',
'Cu', 'Copper',   'No Trend',  'No Trend',   'Declining at Mill Creek***',
'Fe', 'Iron',     'Declining', 'Declining',  'Declining',
'Hg', 'Mercury',  'No Trend',  'No Trend',   'Increasing at Spring Point****',
'Ni', 'Nickle',   'No Trend',  'No Trend',   'No Trend',
'Pb', 'Lead',     'No Trend',  'No Trend',   'No Trend',
'Se', 'Selenium', 'No Trend',  'No Trend',   'No Trend',
'Zn',	'Zinc',     'No Trend',  'No Trend',   'No Trend')

knitr::kable(trends_table)
```
-  * Silver results are influenced by non detects. Elevated detection limits
   in 2007 and to a lesser extent in 2014 dominate the  analysis. So trends
   detected in these analyses are not supported by observed values. This
   problem is an excellent example of why we prefer to use
   statistically-based estimates of censored values.  
   
-  ** Aluminum shows a significant decline by `mblm()`, but not by the closely
   related Kendall's Tau (implemented in he `cor()` function using
   `method = 'kendall'`).  Kendall's Tau is our preferred test for significance.  
    
-  *** Copper trend at Mill Creek is due to one very high observation at Mill
   Creek in 2006. Although the trend is nominally statistically significant,
   its dependence on a single observation makes it less than compelling.

- **** Mercury confidence interval for Spring Point does not include zero, but
   it is very close. Given uncertainty about model specification, we should not
   take the implied confidence interval probability (nominally 95%) very
   seriously. This trend should be considered provisional. Given the large
   number of comparisons we have run here, and the lack of support for trends in
   the other models, we should not take this too seriously.

So, results across multiple tests are fairly consistent.  But we should be
careful because there are multiple comarisons here, so by chance we expect some
significant results that are probably meaningless.

## Summary Table
We can summarize results as follows:
```{r summary_table}
sum_table <- tribble(
  ~Metal, ~Result,
  'Arsenic',  'Increasing',
  'Chromium', 'Declining at East End and Spring Point',
  'Iron',     'Declining',
  'Mercury',  'Weak evidence for an increase at Spring Point.'
)
