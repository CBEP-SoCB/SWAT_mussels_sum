# Introduction
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.

In this notebook we examine how units of concentration are expressed, and
develop a strategy to generate data in consistent units regardless of how data
was originally expressed.


# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(htmltools)  # used by knitr called here only to avoid startup text later in document
library(knitr)

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()
theme_set

library(LCensMeans)
```
# Load Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
auntfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
grandparent <- dirname(parent)
aunt  <- file.path(grandparent,auntfldnm)
fn <- 'CascoBaySWATtissue_Bohlen.xlsx'
```

## Copy Data
This is a larger data file that takes some time to load.  Getting the column
types right dramatically improves load speed. Much of the data is qualitative,
and can't be handled in R.
```{r copy_data}
SWAT_data <- read_excel(file.path(aunt, fn), 
    sheet = "Mussels Data", col_types = c("numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text"))

before <- nrow(SWAT_data)
```

## Remove duplicates
Many samples -- nearly 20% -- are members of a group of duplicates.  We can
think of no valid reason why two records should be exact duplicates in this
setting, so we remove all duplicates using the unique() function.

```{r}
SWAT_data <- unique(SWAT_data)
```

## Simplify Data and Add Unique Sample Codes
This logic was developed in "SWAT_data examination_UNIQUE.Rmd".
```{r}
SWAT_simplified <- SWAT_data %>%
  # Eliminate uninformative identifiers
  select    (-`SAMPLE TYPE`, -`SAMPLE POINT TYPE`, -`SAMPLE LOCATION`,
             -`RESULT TYPE`, -`PARAMETER_QUALIFIER`, -`PARAMETER FILTERED`,
             -`SAMPLE FILTER`, -`DEPTH`, -`DEPTH UNITS`,
             -TREATMENT, -`METER_CALIBRATED`) %>%
  
  # Eliminate data we will not analyze
  select    (-SITE_DESCRIPTION, -ANALYSIS_DATE,
             -`QC TYPE`, -SAMPLED_BY, -`UNITS DESCRIPTION`,
             -`SAMPLE COMMENT`, -`LAB COMMENT`, -`VALIDATION COMMENT`) %>%
  
  # Create Site Code and Site Name
  mutate    (SiteCode =  sub('.* - ','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`), 
             Site     =  sub(' - .*','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`)) %>%
  select    (-EGAD_SITE_NAME) %>%
  
  # Create Year Time Stamp and (Draft 1) Unique Sample ID
  mutate    (Year  = as.numeric(format(SAMPLE_DATE, '%Y')),
             sample_id = gsub(" ", "_", SAMPLE_ID)) %>%
  group_by  (Year) %>%
  mutate    (tag = as.numeric(factor(SAMPLE_DATE))) %>%
  ungroup   ()  %>%
  mutate    (Code = paste(sample_id, Year, tag, sep = '_')) %>%
  select    (-sample_id, -tag) %>%
  select    (`SITE SEQ`, SiteCode, Site, Year, SAMPLE_DATE,
              SAMPLE_ID, Code, everything())
```

# What Units are Used?
We need to deal with data reported in multiple different units. Our interest
here focuses only on units of concentration.

```{r}
knitr::kable(xtabs(~PARAMETER+`UNITS VALUE`, data  = SWAT_data))
```

*  Lipids, moisture and solids are in percent  
*  Sample weight is in g  
*  metals are in mg/kg or ug/g (roughly, ppm)  
*  Organic contaminants are mostly in ng/g, ng/kg or pg/g 

In other words, there is little consistency.


# Calculate Unit Equivalences
We explore automating assignment of multipliers just to minimize risk of
typographical or other errors.

```{r}
(units <- unique(SWAT_simplified$`UNITS VALUE`))
```
```{r}
(units <- units [-c(3,4,8)])
```
## Metric Prefixes
```{r}
p<- tribble(~Prefix, ~Exponent,
'N',  -9,
'M',  -3,
'K',  +3,
'U',  -6,
'P', -12)
# The following works, but is mighty ugly.  there must be a better way....
p <- p %>% mutate(Multiplier = 10^Exponent) %>% arrange(Exponent)
p
```

## Calculate Multipliers for Units
### Find the Numerator and Denominator
```{r}
(num <-  sub("/.*", '', units))
(den <-  sub("^.*/", '', units))
```
### Construct a Simple Function
That matches units in grams with related exponent.
```{r}
find_exponent <- function (x){
  x <- toupper(x)
  if (nchar(x)==1) return(0)     # units are grams
  pre <- substr(x,1,1)           # Otherwise the first character is a prefix
  if (pre %in% p$Prefix) {       # and we can retrieve the exponent
     return(p$Exponent[p$Prefix == pre])
  }
  else
    return(NA_integer_)
}
find_exponent("NG")
```
### Use lapply to Calculate Net Exponent for Units 
```{r}
conversions <- tibble(units = units, num = num, den = den) %>%
  mutate( numexp = unlist(lapply(num, find_exponent)),
          denexp = unlist(lapply(den, find_exponent)),
          netexp = numexp-denexp,
          conversion  = -netexp) %>%
  arrange(netexp)
conversions
```
To go from a measurement in grams per gram , to a measurement in one of these
other sets of units, you multiply by the conversion



# Express Data in Consistent Units
In other Analyses, we have used ug/g for metals and ng/g for organic
contaminants.  So we will express concentrations in those units,
extracting the correct conversion factors from the conversions table.

The logic is, we go from units to g/g by multiplying by 10^netexp, and get from
g/g to the desired units by multiplying by either 10^6 or 10^9.

######## THIS IS UPSIDE DOWN! #########
```{r}
uggexp <- 6  # to get from grams per gram to micrograms per gram, multiply by 10^6
nggexp <- 9  # to get from grams per gram to nsnograms per gram, multiply by time 10^6

test <- SWAT_simplified %>% 
  select(CONCENTRATION, `UNITS VALUE`) %>%
  mutate(theexp = conversions$netexp[match(`UNITS VALUE`, conversions$units)]) %>%
  mutate(uggconvexp =  theexp + uggexp,
         nggconvexp =  theexp + nggexp) %>%
  mutate(conc_ugg = CONCENTRATION * 10^uggconvexp,
         conc_ngg = CONCENTRATION * 10^nggconvexp,) %>%
  select (-theexp, -uggconvexp, -nggconvexp)
head(test,10)
```
