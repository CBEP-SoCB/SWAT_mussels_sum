# Introduction
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.

Unfortunately, the data delivery contains limited metadata, so it takes some
effort to understand the data format and analyze it correctly.

In this notebook we review pesticides data and calculate total DDT residues.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(htmltools)  # used by knitr called here only to avoid startup text later
library(knitr)
```

# Load Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
auntfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
grandparent <- dirname(parent)
aunt  <- file.path(grandparent,auntfldnm)
fn <- 'CascoBaySWATtissue_Bohlen.xlsx'
```

## Copy Data
This is a larger data file that takes some time to load.  Getting the column
types right dramatically improves load speed. Much of the data is qualitative,
and can't be handled in R.
```{r copy_data}
SWAT_data <- read_excel(file.path(aunt, fn), 
    sheet = "Mussels Data", col_types = c("numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text"))
before <- nrow(SWAT_data)
```

## Remove duplicates
Many samples -- nearly 20% -- are members of a group of duplicates.  We can
think of no valid reason why two records should be exact duplicates in this
setting, so we remove all duplicates using the unique() function.
```{r remove_duplicates}
SWAT_data <- unique(SWAT_data)
```

## Simplify Data and Add Unique Sample Codes
This logic was developed in "SWAT_data examination_UNIQUE.Rmd".
```{r}
SWAT_simplified <- SWAT_data %>%
  # Eliminate uninformative identifiers
  select    (-`SAMPLE TYPE`, -`SAMPLE POINT TYPE`, -`SAMPLE LOCATION`,
             -`RESULT TYPE`, -`PARAMETER_QUALIFIER`, -`PARAMETER FILTERED`,
             -`SAMPLE FILTER`, -`DEPTH`, -`DEPTH UNITS`,
             -TREATMENT, -`METER_CALIBRATED`) %>%
  
  # Eliminate data we will not analyze
  select    (-SITE_DESCRIPTION, -ANALYSIS_DATE,
             -`QC TYPE`, -SAMPLED_BY, -`UNITS DESCRIPTION`,
             -`SAMPLE COMMENT`, -`LAB COMMENT`, -`VALIDATION COMMENT`) %>%
  
  # Create Site Code and Site Name
  mutate    (SiteCode =  sub('.* - ','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`), 
             Site     =  sub(' - .*','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`)) %>%
  select    (-EGAD_SITE_NAME) %>%
  
  # Create Year Time Stamp and (Draft 1) Unique Sample ID
  mutate    (Year  = as.numeric(format(SAMPLE_DATE, '%Y')),
             sample_id = gsub(" ", "_", SAMPLE_ID)) %>%
  group_by  (Year) %>%
  mutate    (tag = as.numeric(factor(SAMPLE_DATE))) %>%
  ungroup   ()  %>%
  mutate    (Code = paste(sample_id, Year, tag, sep = '_')) %>%
  select    (-sample_id, -tag) %>%
  select    (`SITE SEQ`, SiteCode, Site, Year, SAMPLE_DATE,
              SAMPLE_ID, Code, everything())
```

## Add Class to the Working Data
We can then read in the resulting Excel File to provide groupings...
```{r}
Parameter_List <- read_excel(file.path(parent,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
    sheet = "Parameter List") %>%
  mutate(Class = factor(Class)) %>%
  arrange(Class, PARAMETER)

SWAT_simplified <- SWAT_simplified %>% 
  mutate(Class = Parameter_List$Class[match(PARAMETER, Parameter_List$PARAMETER)])
```

# Calculate DDT Residues
We can pull the DDT, DDE, and DDD parameters as follows.  Once we identify these
records, we can calculate totals and add them to the data set for further
analysis.
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  filter(grepl('DD[TDE]', PARAMETER)) %>%
  select(PARAMETER) %>%
  unique()
```


```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  filter(grepl('DD[TDE]', PARAMETER))

```


We have non-detects reported in these data, so we do  need to
deal with them. 

Although we prefer to calculate ND estimates based on statistical methods,
we can not recalculate all the other totals in these data, because of
inconsistencies in how they were reported. We have to rely on the calculated
total by DEP staff, which reported totals treating ND as zero, half the
Reporting Limit (RL), or equal to the RL.

Of those three options, we arbitrarily use the option that non-detects are
replaced with one half of the detection limits.  Accordingly, when we have
non-detects, we replace values with one half of the reporting limit.

We also have multiple values for many of these samples. These are values
reported on WET WEIGHT, DRY WEIGHT, and LIPID WEIGHT basis.  We do not want to
average or sum across those values.  We focus only on the DRY WEIGHT basis
results.

```{r}
ddt_data <- SWAT_simplified %>%
  # Filter to DDT residues, dry weight only
  filter(grepl('DD[TDE]', PARAMETER)) %>%
  filter(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'DRY') %>%
  
  # Calculate concentrations, addressing NDs
  mutate(conc = if_else(is.na(`LAB QUALIFIER`), CONCENTRATION,
                        if_else(`LAB QUALIFIER` == 'U' ,
                                RL/2,
                                CONCENTRATION))) %>%
  # Calculate sums across parameters
  group_by(SAMPLE_ID, SAMPLE_DATE, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID) %>%
  summarize(number = sum(! is.na(conc)),
            conc = sum(conc, na.rm = TRUE),
            Parameter = 'Total DDT')
```
