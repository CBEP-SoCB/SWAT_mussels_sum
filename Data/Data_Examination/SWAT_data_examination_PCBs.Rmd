# Introduction
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.

Unfortunately, the data delivery contains limited metadata, so it takes some
effort to understand the data format and analyze it correctly.

In this notebook we review the parameters identified in the data related to
PCBs.  We focus on a number of technical matters dealing with how  totals were
calculated.  These include:  
*  Figuring out which compounds were included in
   various totals.   
*  Determining how non-detects were included in totals.

DEP staff pointed us towards the detailed documentation in the 2017-2018 SWAT
data report for details of how totals were calculated. This provided
a detailed list of parameters used to summarize PCBs using  analytic
totals that can be compared on a more or less consistent basis with benchmarks
from Gulfwatch and NOAA's National Status and Trends studies.

    Toxics Monitoring Program.  2017-2018 Report to the Joint Committee on
    Environmental and Natural Resources.  129th Legislature, First Session.
    
The central challenge here relates to comparing and calculating various totals
either included or not included in the original data.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(htmltools)  # used by knitr called here only to avoid startup text later
library(knitr)

library(CBEPgraphics)

library(LCensMeans)
```

# Utility Function
## Add_if_list
The following function  wraps calculation of sums of items based on 
inclusion in a list into a function and provides useful diagnostic warnings.
A function is especially useful for incorporation into a pipeline that
relies on grouped dataframes, or using sapply or lapply.  The error messages
would be more informative if they provided information on which sample the 
missing data was associated with.

We don't actually end up using this function in the current (4/11/2020)version
of the notebook, but we keep it here in case we need it later during revisions.
```{r}
add_if_list <- function(parms, vals, sel) {
  # parms -- vector of parameter names associated with specific values
  # vals  -- data, some of which you want to add together, based on parm value
  # sel   -- vector of strings indicating which
  # 
  stopifnot(length(parms) == length(vals),  # each value has a parameter name
            ! is.null(labs) | length(parms) == length(labs), # and labels too, if given
            typeof(parms) == typeof(sel))   # crude test for compatibiity
  if (! all(sel %in% parms)) {
    miss <- sel[! (sel %in% parms)]
      warning('The following parameters are missing:\n')
      walk(miss, function(X) warning('\t', X, '\n'))
  }
  sum(vals[parms %in% sel], na.rm = TRUE)
}
```


# Load Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
auntfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
grandparent <- dirname(parent)
aunt  <- file.path(grandparent,auntfldnm)
fn <- 'CascoBaySWATtissue_Bohlen.xlsx'
```

## Copy Data
This is a larger data file that takes some time to load.  Getting the column
types right dramatically improves load speed. Much of the data is qualitative,
and can't be handled in R.
```{r copy_data}
SWAT_data <- read_excel(file.path(aunt, fn), 
    sheet = "Mussels Data", col_types = c("numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text"))
before <- nrow(SWAT_data)
```

## Remove duplicates
Many samples -- nearly 20% -- are members of a group of duplicates.  We can
think of no valid reason why two records should be exact duplicates in this
setting, so we remove all duplicates using the unique() function.
```{r remove_duplicates}
SWAT_data <- unique(SWAT_data)
```

## Simplify Data and Add Unique Sample Codes
This logic was developed in "SWAT_data examination_UNIQUE.Rmd".
```{r}
SWAT_simplified <- SWAT_data %>%
  # Eliminate uninformative identifiers
  select    (-`SAMPLE TYPE`, -`SAMPLE POINT TYPE`, -`SAMPLE LOCATION`,
             -`RESULT TYPE`, -`PARAMETER_QUALIFIER`, -`PARAMETER FILTERED`,
             -`SAMPLE FILTER`, -`DEPTH`, -`DEPTH UNITS`,
             -TREATMENT, -`METER_CALIBRATED`) %>%
  
  # Eliminate data we will not analyze
  select    (-SITE_DESCRIPTION, -ANALYSIS_DATE,
             -`QC TYPE`, -SAMPLED_BY, -`UNITS DESCRIPTION`,
             -`SAMPLE COMMENT`, -`LAB COMMENT`, -`VALIDATION COMMENT`) %>%
  
  # Create Site Code and Site Name
  mutate    (SiteCode =  sub('.* - ','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`), 
             Site     =  sub(' - .*','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`)) %>%
  select    (-EGAD_SITE_NAME) %>%
  
  # Create Year Time Stamp and (Draft 1) Unique Sample ID
  mutate    (Year  = as.numeric(format(SAMPLE_DATE, '%Y')),
             sample_id = gsub(" ", "_", SAMPLE_ID)) %>%
  group_by  (Year) %>%
  mutate    (tag = as.numeric(factor(SAMPLE_DATE))) %>%
  ungroup   ()  %>%
  mutate    (Code = paste(sample_id, Year, tag, sep = '_')) %>%
  select    (-sample_id, -tag) %>%
  select    (`SITE SEQ`, SiteCode, Site, Year, SAMPLE_DATE,
              SAMPLE_ID, Code, everything())

rm(SWAT_data)
```

## Add Class to the Working Simplified Data
We read data from the `Parameter List.xlsx` Excel File to provide groupings.
```{r}
Parameter_List <- read_excel(file.path(parent,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
    sheet = "Parameter List") %>%
  mutate(Class = factor(Class)) %>%
  arrange(Class, PARAMETER)

SWAT_simplified <- SWAT_simplified %>% 
  mutate(Class = Parameter_List$Class[match(PARAMETER, Parameter_List$PARAMETER)])
rm(Parameter_List)
```

# Create PCB-only Data
But want to restrict to PCB data only, expressed on a dry weight basis.
We had trouble because we lost certain parameters in deriving this data subset,
presumably when we selected only dry weigh basis samples.

```{r}
pcb_data_1 <- SWAT_simplified %>%
  filter(grepl('PCB', Class))
```

```{r}
pcb_data_2 <- pcb_data_1 %>%
  filter(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET')
```

```{r}
pcb_data_3 <- pcb_data_1 %>%
  filter(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'DRY')
```

```{r}
pcb_data_4 <- pcb_data_1 %>%
  filter(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'LIP')
```


```{r}
a  <- levels(factor(pcb_data_1$PARAMETER))
b  <- levels(factor(pcb_data_2$PARAMETER))
c  <- levels(factor(pcb_data_3$PARAMETER))
d  <- levels(factor(pcb_data_4$PARAMETER))

length(a)
length(b)
length(c)
length(d)
```
So, by restricting to dry weight only, certain parameters vanish entirely.
That makes little sense.

```{r}
a[! a %in% c]
```
```{r}
pcb_data_1 %>%
  filter(PARAMETER %in% a[! a %in% c]) %>%
  select(Code, `ANALYSIS LAB`, PARAMETER, CONCENTRATION,
         `LAB QUALIFIER`, RL, `WEIGHT BASIS`) %>%
  arrange(Code)
```

These are ALL 2003 data, and all PACE ANALYTICAL Laboratory.  The 
PCB data from later years is is from AXYS ANALYTICAL SERVICES.

One possibility is that these parameters were only available from PACE, but that
PACE did not provide moisture data, or moisture data was not recorded from those 
early years.  In the absence of moisture  data, you can not calculate dry weight
values.

We can look at the data from one sample and review all parameters
available.  IF the data lacks basic physical parameters, like moisture, that may
explain the discrepancy.
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  filter(Code == 'CBFROR_REP_1_2003_4') %>%
  select(PARAMETER, `WEIGHT BASIS`, Class) %>%
  arrange(Class, PARAMETER)
```

So that appears to be the case.  This sample, at least, has no moisture or lipid
data, so data can not be re-expressed on a dry-weight basis.

It is not clear why these parameters are not available from Axys.  We will
explore that later.

We accept that we can not use the 2003 PCB data because it can not be expressed
on a dry-weight basis, and create a reduced PCBs data set here
```{r}
pcb_data <- pcb_data_3
rm(pcb_data_1, pcb_data_2, pcb_data_3, pcb_data_4)
```

# PCB Reference Levels
There is no simple way to establish toxicity benchmarks for edible tissue. Maine
DEP compares values of analytic totals to prevalence benchmarks (medians
and 85th percentiles) derived from the Gulfwatch and National Status And trends
monitoring programs, as published by Leblanc et al. 2009.

> Leblanc, L.A., Krahforst, C.F., Aub√©, J., Roach, S., Brun, G., Harding, G.,
  Hennigar, P., Page, D., Jones, S., Shaw, S., Stahlnecker, J., Schwartz, J.,
  Taylor, D., Thorpe, B., & Wells, P. (2009).  Eighteenth Year of the Gulf of
  Maine Environmental Monitoring Program.

We copied benchmark tables from (an on-line version of) Leblanc et al. 2009 into
our excel spreadsheet, and read those benchmarks in here.

```{r}
references <- read_excel(file.path(parent,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
                             sheet = "Organic Comparisons",
                         range = 'a3:f8') %>%
  rename('Reference_ngg' = ...1) %>%
  filter(! is.na(Reference_ngg))
```

The trick is, these benchmarks are based on a subset of all PCBs studied over
the years.  To use these references, we need to calculate similar sums. They
were not provided in teh  EGAD data.

# PCB Totals
We look  narrowly at DRY weights and totals that treat non-detects as one half
the Reporting Limit. We make the assumption for now that the lessons learned
from that subset apply to  related data.

```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  filter(((grepl('TOTAL', PARAMETER) &
             grepl('PCB', PARAMETER) ) &
         (grepl('ND=1\\/2 DL', PARAMETER) |
             grepl('-H$', PARAMETER))) |
           PARAMETER == 'PCBS')  %>%
  select(PARAMETER) %>%
  unique()
```

We have two different PCB totals, 'TOTAL PCB-H', and 'PCBS', and one total
based on toxic equivalents.  It is not immediately obvious what the two totals
represent.  The nomenclature does not map onto the values reported by DEP or
included in the Leblanc et al. 2009 reference levels.

The SWAT report discusses "SWAT PCBs" or "$\Sigma35$ PCBS" on the one hand, or
"Gulfwatch", "NS&T", or "$\Sigma31$ PCBS" on the other. It is not immediately
obvious how any of the totals we have available relate to those categories.

We need to figure out whether and how the two totals compare to the NS&T and
Gulfwatch reference figures we have available, which were called "PCB21" in  the
Leblanc et al. reference.

One clue comes from a paragraph on page 75 of the SWAT report:
>  Figure 1.3.3.1.1 compares the SWAT PCBs (Œ£35 PCBs) at the 2017 SWAT mussel
   sites to Gulfwatch median and 85th percentile for 2008 PCB data, the most
   recent available. Of the three SWAT mussel sites, only East End Beach,
   Portland, exceeded the Gulfwatch 2008 median of 24.1 ng/g dry wt., and none
   of the sites tested exceeded the Gulfwatch 85th percentile of 35.4 ng/g dry
   wt. for Gulfwatch PCBs.

The values quoted:  
*  Gulfwatch 2008 median of 24.1 ng/g dry weight and  
*  Gulfwatch 85th percentile of 35.4  
Match the values from Leblanc et al. 2009 for PCB21.

A list of the PCBs included in each of the reference totals is provided in table 
1.3.3.1.1 in the report, which is duplicated in `Parameter List.xlsx`. A simple
list of PCBs in each reference total is also provided, in the "PCB_SWAT" and
"PCB_Gulfwatch" tabs.

Now we need to confirm that the totals we have match the totals shown
graphically on the 2017 report averages. Let's look at averages and SDs from
2017 data.

```{r}
pcb_totals <- SWAT_simplified %>%
  filter(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'DRY') %>%
  filter((PARAMETER == 'TOTAL PCB-H') |
          (PARAMETER == 'PCBS'))
```

```{r}
pcb_totals %>%
  filter(Year == 2017) %>%
  select(SiteCode, SAMPLE_ID, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, CONCENTRATION, Year, PARAMETER) %>%
  group_by(Year, SiteCode, PARAMETER) %>%
  summarize(mn =  mean(CONCENTRATION),
            stdev = sd(CONCENTRATION))
```

Those means are very close to the means reported (graphically) in the DEP report
for  "Total PCBs"  Neither is close to the Gulfwatch or SWAT PCB totals, which
are about 40%  as large. The values of hte two totals are too close to tell
which is the better match for the values in the Report graph.

If we want values we can compare to reference benchmarks, we have to recalculate
them.


## When are Each of the Totals Available?
"TOTAL PCB-H" are available most of the time.
```{r}
xtabs(~ SiteCode + Year , data = pcb_data,
      subset = PARAMETER == 'TOTAL PCB-H')
```
PCBs are available slightly less often -- fewer sites, and fewer years.
Principally, "TOTAL PCB-H" was used in 2007 and 2008.
```{r}
xtabs(~ SiteCode + Year , data = pcb_data,
      subset = PARAMETER == 'PCBS')
```

## Compare the two Totals
```{r}
pcb_data %>%
  select(SiteCode, SAMPLE_ID, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, CONCENTRATION, Year, PARAMETER) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = PARAMETER, values_from = CONCENTRATION) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(`TOTAL PCB-H` = mean(`TOTAL PCB-H`),
            `PCBS`        = mean(`PCBS`),
            diff = `TOTAL PCB-H`- `PCBS`)
```
In general, TOTAL PCB-H is slightly higher, as shown by differences of annual
averages.

```{r}
pcb_data %>%
  select(SiteCode, SAMPLE_ID, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, CONCENTRATION, Year, PARAMETER) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = PARAMETER, values_from = CONCENTRATION) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(diff = `TOTAL PCB-H`- `PCBS`) %>%
  pull(diff) %>%
  summary()
```
And that is true of the median as well, but the mean difference sample by sample 
is dominated by a few very large differences going the other way.

Note, we have at least one laboratory duplicate in here, so we need to include
the ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID as part of the id_cols for the pivot wider command.
```{r}
plt <- pcb_data %>%
  select(SiteCode, SAMPLE_ID, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, CONCENTRATION, Year, PARAMETER) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = PARAMETER, values_from = CONCENTRATION) %>%
  ggplot(aes(`TOTAL PCB-H`, `PCBS`)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12)
plt
```
The two Totals, where we have both, are NEARLY identical. "TOTAL PCB-H" is,
on average, higher in every sample, but there are two samples where `PCBs` were
much higher.  That could be some sort of an error, but there is no
way, *a priori*, to figure it out for sure without recalculating our own totals,
which we are trying to avoid.

We can look at ranges at site and Year sample codes...
```{r}
pcb_data %>%
  filter(PARAMETER == 'TOTAL PCB-H') %>%
  group_by(Year, SiteCode) %>%
  summarize(rng = max(CONCENTRATION) - min(CONCENTRATION)) %>%
  pull(rng) %>%
  sort()
```
```{r}
pcb_data %>%
  filter(PARAMETER == 'PCBS') %>%
  group_by(Year, SiteCode) %>%
  summarize(rng = max(CONCENTRATION) - min(CONCENTRATION)) %>%
  pull(rng) %>%
  sort()
```
So...  the largest inter-group differences occur in 'TOTAL PCB-H', but not by
that much.

Note also that 'PCBS' appear to be rounded to nearest 10, while 'TOTAL PCB-H' is
not.

## Conclusion:
We should work with 'TOTAL PCB-H', which is both more complete, and apparently
more precise (in terms of decimal representation, not measurement accuracy).



# PCB Nomenclature
PCBs are sometimes reported in the EGAD data as individual PCBS and sometimes by
PCB Number.

All the PCBs listed by PCB number are mixtures of PCBs, probably "co-eluted'
PCBs. They are given DEP identifiers, not true CAS registration numbers, in the
CAS_NO field.

So, PCBs are reported in the following ways: 
*  Individual PCBs under chemical names
*  Mixtures of co-eluted PCBs under congener numbers (separated by slashes.)
*  Calculated totals of various kinds.

It is confusing that some PCBs are listed by PCB number and some are listed by
chemical name.  This poses problems matching chemicals with the lists of PCBs
included in various totals and groups, which typically use one approach or the
other (see below).

## Load PCB Nomenclature Table
We load a table that includes several different ways of naming PCBs, including
by CAS Registration Number, by PCB Congener number, and by chemical name.
The table provides a way to translate between different ways of naming the same
PCBs.
```{r}
pcb_translator <-  read_excel(file.path(parent,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
                             sheet = "PCB Nomenclature")

```
We can look up PCBs by CAS number or by chemical name. Unfortunately, neither 
is "spelled" the same in the DEP data and in the table of nomenclature.

Official CAS numbers in the nomenclature table are structured as follows:

(#)####-##-#,

that is, four or five digits, a dash, two digits, a dash, and one digit.

The CAS numbers column in the DEP database contain not only CAS numbers, but 
also some DEP-specific identifiers for mixtures and totals.  But the CAS numbers
it contains have no dashes. One way to translate may be to convert the CAS
numbers in `pcb_translator` by removing dashes.

Similarly, the chemical names in the DEP database are stored in uppercase, so we
need to convert.

```{r}
pcb_translator <- pcb_translator %>%
  mutate(casrn = gsub('-','', CASRN),
         iupac_name = toupper(`IUPAC Name`))
```

## Developing Consistent Nomenclature based on PCB Congener Numbers
### Create a List of PCB Names Found in the Data
We create a list that includes all chemical names and CAS numbers from the PCB
data from DEP (omitting calculated totals). This allows us to test our matching
code on a simplified data set, making it easier to figure out if things are
working as expected.  The table is also useful for checking presence of specific
congeners and mixtures in the Axys Analytical data
```{r}
pcb_names <- pcb_data %>%
  select(PARAMETER, CAS_NO) %>%
  filter(! grepl('TOTAL', PARAMETER)) %>%
  filter(! PARAMETER == 'PCBS') %>%
  unique() %>%
  arrange(PARAMETER)
```

### Developing Methods for Matching Data to PAH Congener Number
Because the list of PCBs included in reference sums (as used in the DEP SWAT
report) is expressed in PCB Congener Number terms, we need to produce alternate
nomenclature that is based on PCB Numbers in a consistent way.

#### Match by Chemical Name -- Not successful
```{r}
pcb_names %>%
  left_join(pcb_translator, by = c("PARAMETER" = "iupac_name")) %>%
  select(-CASRN, -Descriptor, -Type, - casrn, -`IUPAC Name`)  %>%
  mutate(PCB_number = paste0('PCB-', `Congener Number`) ) %>%
  arrange(`Congener Number`)
```

One chemical name fails to match:
2',3,4,4',5-PENTACHLOROBIPHENYL	65510443	NA	PCB-NA	

##### Apparent Error in DEP Chemical Name
The entry for `2',3,4,4',5-PENTACHLOROBIPHENY`L` in the DEP data appears to be 
an error.  The chemical with the matching CAS number is, in fact, 
`2,3',4,4',5'-PENTACHLOROBIPHENYL`, Listed as PCB-123. Searching online, we 
could not find a PCB matching the name from the DEP data.  

#### Test Match by CAS Number -- Successful
```{r}
pcb_names %>%
  left_join(pcb_translator, by = c("CAS_NO" = "casrn")) %>%
  select(-CASRN, -Descriptor, -Type, -`IUPAC Name`, -iupac_name)  %>%
  mutate(PCB_number = paste0('PCB-', `Congener Number`) ) %>%
  arrange(`Congener Number`) %>%
  select(-`Congener Number`)
```
None fail to match by CAS_NO.  Since matching by CAS number works consistently,
we will use that.

## Add Congener Number to PCB Names Data
We generate a new column of PCB names, by matching CAS number, add names where
matches occur, and retain the old names, where they already are in PCB number
format (specifically for co-eluted mixtures).
```{r}
pcb_names <- pcb_names %>%
  left_join(pcb_translator, by = c("CAS_NO" = "casrn")) %>%
  select(-CASRN, -Descriptor, -Type, -`IUPAC Name`, -iupac_name)  %>%
  mutate(PCB_number = paste0('PCB-', `Congener Number`) ) %>%
  mutate(pcb_congener_names = if_else(grepl('PCB', PARAMETER),
                            PARAMETER,
                            PCB_number)) %>%
  mutate(pcb_congener_names = if_else(pcb_congener_names == 'PCB-NA',
                                       NA_character_,
                                       pcb_congener_names)) %>%
  arrange(`Congener Number`) %>%
  select(-`Congener Number`, -PCB_number)
pcb_names
```

### Are All PCB Congeners Represented?
We want to "unpack" the PCB nomenclature we developed (based on the Axys
Analytic data) and see if all PCBs are represented in the data.  The magic
function here is `separate_rows()`.
```{r}
pcb_names %>%
  select(pcb_congener_names) %>%
  mutate(available_nums  = sub('PCB-', '', pcb_congener_names)) %>%
  separate_rows(available_nums) %>%
  mutate(available_nums = as.numeric(available_nums)) %>%
  arrange(available_nums)
```
PCB numbers 1 through 209 are represented in pcb_names ONCE AND ONLY
ONCE. That's good.

## Add Congener Number to PCB Data
We generate a new column of PCB names, by matching CAS number, add names where
matches occur, and retain the old names, where they already are in PCB number
format (specifically for co-eluted mixtures).
```{r}
pcb_data <- pcb_data %>%
  left_join(pcb_translator, by = c("CAS_NO" = "casrn")) %>%
  select(-CASRN, -Descriptor, -Type, -`IUPAC Name`, -iupac_name)  %>%
  mutate(PCB_number = paste0('PCB-', `Congener Number`) ) %>%
  mutate(pcb_congener_names = if_else(grepl('PCB', PARAMETER),
                            PARAMETER,
                            PCB_number)) %>%
  mutate(pcb_congener_names = if_else(pcb_congener_names == 'PCB-NA',
                                       NA_character_,
                                       pcb_congener_names)) %>%
  arrange(`Congener Number`) %>%
  select(-`Congener Number`, -PCB_number)
```


# Calculating Reference Sums.
The DEP 2017-2018 SWAT report states:

>  To compare Maine results to the NS&T and Gulfwatch PCBs, this report sums 35
   congeners in the Maine SWAT PCB data, including 27 of 31 PCB congeners on the
   NS&T/Gulfwatch list, while including an additional 6 congeners that are not
   on the NS&T/Gulfwatch list. This difference is due to some congeners
   co-eluting differently or being summed differently at the various
   laboratories. These 35 summed congeners will be called ‚ÄúSWAT PCBs‚Äù for the
   purposes of this report.

In other words, DEP uses "SWAT PCBs" to compare to the Gulfwatch and NS&T
benchmarks as the best approximation possible given the different laboratories
involved. We will follow a similar practice here.

A comparison of the two lists of PCBs is provided in Table 1.3.3.1.1 of the DEP
report.  Each list is also provided as a tab in our `Parameter Lists.xlsx`
spreadsheet.  Although we will only use the SWAT list, we provide both,as we 
will carefully check availability of parameters on both lists in he Axys
Analytical data.

## Load Parameter ListS
```{r}
swat_list <- read_excel(file.path(parent,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
                             sheet = "PCB_SWAT") %>%
  pull(SWAT_PCBs_35)
swat_list
```

```{r}
gulfwatch_list <- read_excel(file.path(parent,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
                             sheet = "PCB_Gulfwatch") %>%
  pull(Gulfwatch_PCBs_31)
gulfwatch_list
```


## A Caution
The SWAT data "PARAMETER" codes differ from the list of parameters in
Table 1.3.3.1.1 because, when designating co-eluted mixtures of PCBs, the
PARAMETER codes in the EGAD data include leading zeros in front of two digit
Congener Numbers. The table entries from the DEP report lack the leading zero.

To address that, we hand-edited the Excel File to provide a column of data that
DOES include those leading zeros.  In the following, we use the edited data
columns.

## Compare Parameter Lists for Presence of Congeners
We want to know how the lists of congeners in the two lists differ.  This is
partly a check on the information in the Table from the DEEP report, and
partly a check on the adequacy of the comparison between the two lists.
```{r}
swat_nums <- tibble(SWAT = swat_list) %>%
  mutate(nums = sub('PCB-', '', SWAT)) %>%
  separate_rows(nums) %>%
  mutate(nums = as.numeric(nums))%>%
  arrange(nums) %>%
  pull(nums) %>%
  unique()
```

```{r}
gulfwatch_nums <- tibble(Gulfwatch = gulfwatch_list) %>%
  mutate(nums = sub('PCB-', '', Gulfwatch)) %>%
  separate_rows(nums) %>%
  mutate(nums = as.numeric(nums)) %>%
  arrange(nums) %>%
  pull(nums)%>%
  unique()


cat('In SWAT, not in Gulfwatch\n')
swat_nums[! swat_nums %in% gulfwatch_nums]
cat('\nIn Gulfwatch not in SWAT\n')
gulfwatch_nums[! gulfwatch_nums %in% swat_nums]
```

### Inconsistency
Those lists **DO NOT** match the lists of "Unique to SWAT" and "Unique to
Gulfwatch" provides in Table 1.3.3.1.1.  The lists are nearly identical, but not
quite.

Our search identifies TWO PCB Congeners in the SWAT list that are not in the 
Gulfwatch list. DEP apparently missed these congeners in their review:  
*  PCB-113 (part of PCB-090/101/113)  
*  PCB 168  (part of PCB-153/168)  

## Test for Missing Parameters.
We now  scan through the data to check if the requisite parameters are
available. Since DEP selected the parameters for their SWAT list, all
parameters included in that list should be available.  Several parameters, in
the Gulfwatch List should NOT be available, since they are based on the older
analytic chemistry.

### SWAT List
```{r}
tmp <- pcb_data %>%
  select(Code, `ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID`, pcb_congener_names) %>%
  group_by(Code, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(res1 = list(swat_list[! swat_list %in% unlist(data[[1]])]))
(res1 <- tmp$res1[[1]])
(missing_congeners <- as.numeric(sub('PCB-', '', res1)))


```
So all parameters included in the SWAT list are available from the Axys
Analytical data, as expected.

### Gulfwatch List
```{r}
tmp <- pcb_data %>%
  select(Code, `ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID`, pcb_congener_names) %>%
  group_by(Code, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(res2 = list(gulfwatch_list[! gulfwatch_list %in% unlist(data[[1]])]))
(res2 <- tmp$res2[[1]])
(missing_congeners <- sub('PCB-', '', res2))
```
And many PCB groups or individual compounds listed in the original Gulfwatch list
are not available, also as expected.

## Calculate the SWAT Sum
This code conducts the following steps:
1.  filter to a dataset that includes only the parameters we want,
2.  Replace non-detects with half the relevant reporting limit
3.  group by sample and lab replicate
4.  Calculate Sums, and provide default values for 
```{r}
pcb_swat <- pcb_data %>%
  # Filter to SWAT PCBs
  filter(pcb_congener_names %in% swat_list) %>%
  
  # Address NDs
  mutate(CONCENTRATION = if_else(is.na(`LAB QUALIFIER`), CONCENTRATION,
                        if_else(`LAB QUALIFIER` == 'U',
                                RL/2,
                                CONCENTRATION))) %>%
  
  # Calculate sums across parameters
  group_by(Code, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID) %>%
  summarize(conc = sum(CONCENTRATION, na.rm = TRUE),
            PARAMETER = 'swat_pcbs_35',
            `UNITS VALUE` = 'PG/G',
            `TEST METHOD` = 'Calculated',
            Class = 'PCB Calculated',
            .groups   = 'drop') 
pcb_swat
```

Now, we need to assemble full rows of data.  We do that by selecting an
arbitrary row from the matching sample, stripping out all parameter specific
information, leaving only the sample-specific data, and then joining.

### Assemble Full Data Rows
```{r}
# Select the first matching record.  We might actually get a few too many,
# Since we search for all records that match the sample code.
ancillary_data <- pcb_data %>%
  filter(Code %in% pcb_swat$Code ) %>%
  group_by(Code, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID) %>%
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>%
 
  # Now, drop any data that is sample-specific.  We simply drop those data
  # columns.  When we `bind_rows()` later, missing columns will be filled in 
  # with NA.
  
  select(-c(`TEST METHOD`:pcb_congener_names))

# Finally, we use the inner join to combine data
pcb_swat <- ancillary_data %>%
  inner_join(pcb_swat, by = c('Code', 'ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID'))
pcb_swat
#rm(ancillary_data)
```

### Add those totals to the PCB data dataset.
```{r}
pcb_data <- pcb_data %>%
  bind_rows(pcb_swat)
```

# Compare SWAT Sum to 2017 published Results
Now, lets calculate the desired sum and compare to results reported.
```{r}
pcb_data %>%
  filter (Year == 2017) %>%
  filter(PARAMETER =='swat_pcbs_35')%>%
  group_by(SiteCode) %>%
  summarize(avg = mean(conc))
```

And those averages do, in fact, look very similar to the levels shown in the graphic from
the DEP SWAT Report from 2017 and 2018.
