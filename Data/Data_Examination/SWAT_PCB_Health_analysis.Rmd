# Introduction
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.

In this Notebook, we analyze PCB contaminants found in blue mussel (*Mytilus
edulis*) tissue.  Our focus is on comparison to "fish tissue action levels" or
FTALs.  FTALs are expressed o a wet weight basis, which is why this analysis is
separate from other analyses of PCBs. 

We focus on the following analytic totals:
* Total PCBs,
* PCB TEQs 

##  PCB TEQ comparisons.
TEQs (Toxic Equivalents) use weighted sums of concentrations of toxic chemicals
used to estimate overall toxicity of  mixtures.  The idea is that by weighting
concentrations by very rough (order of magnitude) weights based on relative
toxicity (called Toxic Equivalency Factors or "TEFs"), you can get some idea
of whether a mixture poses toxic risk or not. TEQs are compared to published
toxicity benchmarks.

# Related Health Standards
DEP staff pointed us towards the detailed documentation in the 2017-2018 SWAT
data report.

>   Maine Department of Environmental Protection.  2019.  Surface Water Ambient
    Toxics Monitoring Program.  2017-2018 Report to the Joint Committee on
    Environmental and Natural Resources.  129th Legislature, First Session.

That document refers to "MCDC Fish Tissue Action Levels." and FDA Action Levels.
After some digging, we found a document on the Maine CDC website that
corresponds to (most or all of) the FTALs reported by DEP.

>  Maine Center for Disease Control. 2001.  Bureau of Health Fish Tissue Action Levels.  https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/environmental-health/eohp/fish/documents/action-levels-writeup.pdf.  Accessed 11/10/2020.

The Maine CDC document does not include action levels for TEQs. We pulled
related action levels from the DEP SWAT report.

The relevant Maine health reference level are these (1 ppb = 1 ng/g):

**THESE REFERENCE LEVELS ARE ON A WET WEIGHT BASIS**

Chemical Group| Non-Cancer Action Level | Cancer Action Level | Source |  
--------------|-------------------------|---------------------|--------|  
PCBs          |   11      ppb           | 43      ppb         | MCDC   |  
Dioxins       |    0.0015 ppb           | 0.0019 ppb          | MCDC   |  
TEQ           |                         | 0.4 pg/g = .0004 ppb| DEP    |   

# Load Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()
theme_set(theme_cbep())
```

## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
auntfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
grandparent <- dirname(parent)
aunt  <- file.path(grandparent,auntfldnm)
fn <- 'CascoBaySWATtissue_Bohlen.xlsx'
```

## Copy Data
This is a larger data file that takes some time to load.  Getting the column
types right dramatically improves load speed. Much of the data is qualitative,
and can't be handled in R.
```{r copy_data}
SWAT_data <- read_excel(file.path(aunt, fn), 
    sheet = "Mussels Data", col_types = c("numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text"))
before <- nrow(SWAT_data)
```

## Remove duplicates
Many samples -- nearly 20% -- are members of a group of duplicates.  We can
think of no valid reason why two records should be exact duplicates in this
setting, so we remove all duplicates using the unique() function.
```{r remove_duplicates}
SWAT_data <- unique(SWAT_data)
```

## Simplify Data and Add Unique Sample Codes
This logic was developed in "SWAT_data examination_UNIQUE.Rmd".
```{r}
SWAT_simplified <- SWAT_data %>%
  # Eliminate uninformative identifiers
  select    (-`SAMPLE TYPE`, -`SAMPLE POINT TYPE`, -`SAMPLE LOCATION`,
             -`RESULT TYPE`, -`PARAMETER_QUALIFIER`, -`PARAMETER FILTERED`,
             -`SAMPLE FILTER`, -`DEPTH`, -`DEPTH UNITS`,
             -TREATMENT, -`METER_CALIBRATED`) %>%
  
  # Eliminate data we will not analyze
  select    (-SITE_DESCRIPTION, -ANALYSIS_DATE,
             -`QC TYPE`, -SAMPLED_BY, -`UNITS DESCRIPTION`,
             -`SAMPLE COMMENT`, -`LAB COMMENT`, -`VALIDATION COMMENT`) %>%
  
  # Create Site Code and Site Name
  mutate    (SiteCode =  sub('.* - ','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`), 
             Site     =  sub(' - .*','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`)) %>%
  select    (-EGAD_SITE_NAME) %>%
  
  # Create Year Time Stamp and (Draft 1) Unique Sample ID
  mutate    (Year  = as.numeric(format(SAMPLE_DATE, '%Y')),
             sample_id = gsub(" ", "_", SAMPLE_ID)) %>%
  group_by  (Year) %>%
  mutate    (tag = as.numeric(factor(SAMPLE_DATE))) %>%
  ungroup   ()  %>%
  mutate    (Code = paste(sample_id, Year, tag, sep = '_')) %>%
  select    (-sample_id, -tag) %>%
  select    (`SITE SEQ`, SiteCode, Site, Year, SAMPLE_DATE,
              SAMPLE_ID, Code, everything())
rm(SWAT_data)
```

## Add Class to the Working Simplified Data
We read data from the `Parameter List.xlsx` Excel File to provide groupings.
```{r}
Parameter_List <- read_excel(file.path(parent,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
    sheet = "Parameter List") %>%
  mutate(Class = factor(Class)) %>%
  arrange(Class, PARAMETER)

SWAT_simplified <- SWAT_simplified %>% 
  mutate(Class = Parameter_List$Class[match(PARAMETER, Parameter_List$PARAMETER)])
rm(Parameter_List)
```

# Create PCB-only Data -- Wet Weight Basis!
But want to restrict to PCB data only, expressed on a dry weight basis.
We had trouble because we lost certain parameters in deriving this data subset,
presumably when we selected only dry weigh basis samples.

```{r}
pcb_data <- SWAT_simplified %>%
  filter(grepl('PCB', Class)) %>%
  filter(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  filter(PARAMETER %in% c("PCB TOTAL TEQ (ND=1/2 DL)", "TOTAL PCB-H")) %>%
  rename_with(~tolower(gsub(' ','_', .x, fixed = TRUE)))
```


## Load Location Information
And add a short location name for figures.
```{r}
locations <- read_csv(file.path(parent,"sites_spatial.csv"), 
    col_types = cols(SITESEQ = col_skip(), 
        LAT = col_skip(), LONG = col_skip())) %>%
  mutate(short_locs= c("Back Bay",
                      "Fore River",
                      "Cocktail Cove",
                      "SW Great Diamond",
                      "Navy Pier",
                      "Mill Creek",
                      "Royal River",
                      "Haraseeket",
                      "Falmouth",
                      "Mare Brook",
                      "Fore River",
                      "East End",
                      "Spring Point",
                      "Jewel Island",
                      "Presumpscot",
                      "Middle Bay",
                      "Maquoit Bay",
                      "Inner Fore",
                      "Quahog Bay",
                      "Long Island"))

pcb_data <- pcb_data %>%
  mutate(short_locs = locations$short_locs[match(sitecode,
                                                 locations$SITECODE)])
rm(locations)

```

## Data Subsets
```{r}
pcb_totals_data <- pcb_data %>%
  filter(parameter == "TOTAL PCB-H") %>%
  mutate(short_locs = fct_reorder(short_locs, concentration))

lvls = levels(pcb_totals_data$short_locs)

pcb_teq_data <- pcb_data %>%
  filter(parameter == "PCB TOTAL TEQ (ND=1/2 DL)") %>%
  mutate(short_locs = factor(short_locs, levels =  lvls))
```

## Data Since 2010
Give the paucity of data and sited from 2015 through 2019, we consider "recent"
data to include the lat 10 years, or 2010 through 2019.
```{r}
totals_recent_data <- pcb_totals_data %>%
    filter(year >= 2010)

teq_recent_data <- pcb_teq_data %>%
    filter(year >= 2010)
```

# PCB Graphic
```{r}
plt <- ggplot(totals_recent_data,
              aes(short_locs, concentration)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = year)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 43*1000, lty = 3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 11*1000, lty = 2) +
  scale_y_log10(labels=scales::label_comma()) +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  ylab("Total PCBs (pg/g)") +
  xlab('')
plt
```
So PCB levels in a couple of samples are above health thresholds for PCBs.  This
does not quite match, but is consistent with what DEP has reported on page 78 of
their report. The report only on site averages, so do not highlight individual 
observations that exceed thresholds.

# TEQ Graphic
```{r}
plt <- ggplot(teq_recent_data,
              aes(short_locs, concentration)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = year)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .4, lty = 3) +
  scale_y_log10(labels=scales::label_comma()) +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  ylab("TEQ Concentration (pg/g)") +
  xlab('')
plt
```
Same thing here.  DEP reports on averages, so does not highlight the single
observation above the action level.
