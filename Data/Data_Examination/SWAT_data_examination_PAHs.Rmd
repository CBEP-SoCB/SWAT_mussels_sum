# Introduction
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.

Unfortunately, the data delivery contains limited metadata, so it takes some
effort to understand the data format and analyze it correctly.

In this notebook we review how PAH values were handled in the data and try to
recreate some calculations to check our understanding, and in hopes that we
could recreate some calculations using more modern statistical methods for
addressing non-detects.

# PAHs Totals
In the Leblanc et al. 2009 paper (Table 2), totals (for PAHs) were described as
follows:

Parameter        |         Definition from Leblanc et al 2009
-----------------|-------------------------------------------
PAH19            |Sum of substituted PAHS
-----------------|-------------------------------------------
PAH24            |PAH19 plus "a few alkyl-substituted PAHs, as indicated"
-----------------|-------------------------------------------
Total PAH        |Sum of 40 PAH compounds in the table.
-----------------|-------------------------------------------
PCB21            |The Sum of 21 PCB Congeners, calculated to be consiustent with
                 |NOAA Status and Trends.
-----------------|-------------------------------------------
PEST21           | Sum of chlorinated PEsticides and DDTs

The exact PAH's included in each of the totals are indicated in the tables in
LeBlanc et al. 2009.  We added tabs to the  Excel File "Parameter List.xlsx"
that include each of the parameters metnioned in that table, as best as we can
reconstruct them.

**The Tables in LeBlanc et al. 2009 contain what appear to be errors.
For example, there are 41 PAH compounds listed in Table 2, not 40 as
suggested by the nomenclature.**

A more thorough review of which PAHs were measured from many of these same field
samples is available in the MAine DEP SWAT program's 2017-2018 report to the
legislature:

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(htmltools)  # used by knitr called here only to avoid startup text later
library(knitr)
```

# Load Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
auntfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
grandparent <- dirname(parent)
aunt  <- file.path(grandparent,auntfldnm)
fn <- 'CascoBaySWATtissue_Bohlen.xlsx'
```

## Copy Data
This is a larger data file that takes some time to load.  Getting the column
types right dramatically improves load speed. Much of the data is qualitative,
and can't be handled in R.
```{r copy_data}
SWAT_data <- read_excel(file.path(aunt, fn), 
    sheet = "Mussels Data", col_types = c("numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text"))
before <- nrow(SWAT_data)
```

## Remove duplicates
Many samples -- nearly 20% -- are members of a group of duplicates.  We can
think of no valid reason why two records should be exact duplicates in this
setting, so we remove all duplicates using the unique() function.
```{r remove_duplicates}
SWAT_data <- unique(SWAT_data)
```

## Simplify Data and Add Unique Sample Codes
This logic was developed in "SWAT_data examination_UNIQUE.Rmd".
```{r}
SWAT_simplified <- SWAT_data %>%
  # Eliminate uninformative identifiers
  select    (-`SAMPLE TYPE`, -`SAMPLE POINT TYPE`, -`SAMPLE LOCATION`,
             -`RESULT TYPE`, -`PARAMETER_QUALIFIER`, -`PARAMETER FILTERED`,
             -`SAMPLE FILTER`, -`DEPTH`, -`DEPTH UNITS`,
             -TREATMENT, -`METER_CALIBRATED`) %>%
  
  # Eliminate data we will not analyze
  select    (-SITE_DESCRIPTION, -ANALYSIS_DATE,
             -`QC TYPE`, -SAMPLED_BY, -`UNITS DESCRIPTION`,
             -`SAMPLE COMMENT`, -`LAB COMMENT`, -`VALIDATION COMMENT`) %>%
  
  # Create Site Code and Site Name
  mutate    (SiteCode =  sub('.* - ','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`), 
             Site     =  sub(' - .*','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`)) %>%
  select    (-EGAD_SITE_NAME) %>%
  
  # Create Year Time Stamp and (Draft 1) Unique Sample ID
  mutate    (Year  = as.numeric(format(SAMPLE_DATE, '%Y')),
             sample_id = gsub(" ", "_", SAMPLE_ID)) %>%
  group_by  (Year) %>%
  mutate    (tag = as.numeric(factor(SAMPLE_DATE))) %>%
  ungroup   ()  %>%
  mutate    (Code = paste(sample_id, Year, tag, sep = '_')) %>%
  select    (-sample_id, -tag) %>%
  select    (`SITE SEQ`, SiteCode, Site, Year, SAMPLE_DATE,
              SAMPLE_ID, Code, everything())
```

## Add Class to the Working Data
We can then read in the resulting Excel File to provide groupings...
```{r}
Parameter_List <- read_excel(file.path(parent,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
    sheet = "Parameter List") %>%
  mutate(Class = factor(Class)) %>%
  arrange(Class, PARAMETER)

SWAT_simplified <- SWAT_simplified %>% 
  mutate(Class = Parameter_List$Class[match(PARAMETER, Parameter_List$PARAMETER)])
```


# When Does Each Total Exist?
We look  narrowly at WET weights and totals that treat non-detects as zero.
We make the assumption for now that the lessons learned from that subset apply 
to the related data.
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, `WEIGHT BASIS`,
         PARAMETER, CONCENTRATION) %>%
  filter (`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  filter(grepl('-O$', PARAMETER)) %>%
  filter(grepl("TOTAL PAH/d/d", PARAMETER) |
           grepl("TOTAL PAH", PARAMETER)) %>%
  pivot_wider(c(Code, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID),
              names_from = PARAMETER, values_from = CONCENTRATION) %>%
  mutate(HasTotal = !(is.na(`TOTAL PAH-O` )),
         Has40 = !(is.na( `TOTAL PAH40-O`)),
         Has24 = !(is.na( `TOTAL PAH24-O`)),
         Has19 = !(is.na( `TOTAL PAH19-O`))) %>%
  select(-`TOTAL PAH-O`, -`TOTAL PAH40-O`,
         -`TOTAL PAH24-O`, -`TOTAL PAH19-O`) %>%
  group_by(HasTotal) %>%
  summarize(With40 = sum(Has40),
            With24 = sum(Has24),
            With19 = sum(Has19),
            .groups = 'drop')
```

So measures of the totals are usually all found together.  The 19 PAH subset
is sometimes available when the other totals are NOT available.

# Are Total PAHs and Total PAH40 equal?
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, `WEIGHT BASIS`,
         PARAMETER, CONCENTRATION) %>%
  filter (`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  filter(grepl('-O$', PARAMETER)) %>%
  filter(grepl("TOTAL PAH40", PARAMETER) |
           grepl("TOTAL PAH", PARAMETER)) %>%
  pivot_wider(c(Code, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID),
              names_from = PARAMETER, values_from = CONCENTRATION) %>%
  mutate(same = `TOTAL PAH40-O` == `TOTAL PAH-O`) %>%
  group_by(same) %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            totallarger = sum(`TOTAL PAH40-O` < `TOTAL PAH-O` ))
```
The two values are NOT the same.  When they both exist, TOTAL PAH is always
larger.

# Preparing to Calculate Diagnostic Totals
## Load PAH Lists
```{r}
pah19list <- read_excel(file.path(parent,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
                        sheet = "PAH19 List", col_names = 'Parameter') %>%
  pull('Parameter')
pah24list <- read_excel(file.path(parent,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
                        sheet = "PAH24 List", col_names = 'Parameter') %>%
  pull('Parameter')
pah40list <- read_excel(file.path(parent,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
                        sheet = "PAH40 List", col_names = 'Parameter') %>%
  pull('Parameter')
```

##  Create Helper Function
We need a helper function to make facilitate calculating selective sums.

We want to traverse a pair of vectors so that we add the second value to an 
accumulating sum if and only if the value in out first vector is in our
selection.

But we also want to highlight problems with the input data, such has missing
values.  For a sum to be 100% legitimate, it needs to include all values.

(Option:  Could add parameter to allow user to select how this program behaves
if parameters are missing. Warn, Return NA, Raise Error.)
```{r}
add_if_list <- function(parms, vals, sel) {
  stopifnot(length(parms) == length(vals))
  if (! all(sel %in% parms)) {
    miss <- sel[ ! (sel %in% parms)]
      warning('The following parameters are missing:\n')
      walk(miss, function(X) warning('\t', X, '\n'))
  }
  sum(vals[parms %in% sel], na.rm = TRUE)
}
```

Note that this function warns NOT if data for a particular parameter is
missing, but if there is no entry for that parameter.  This allows us
to accommodate right censored values, where CONCENTRATION is NA, but
there is information on the detection limits (in another column).

# Calculating PAH 19
We can calculate PAH19 totals and compare results to the `TOTAL PAH19` results
provided for (most) samples by DEP.
```{r}
tst <- SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, `WEIGHT BASIS`,
         PARAMETER, CONCENTRATION, Class)%>%
  filter (`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  #filter(grepl('CBANAN_REP_[0-9]_2007_1', Code)) %>%
  filter(grepl('PAH', Class)) %>%
  group_by(Code, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID) %>%
  summarize(PAH19 = add_if_list(PARAMETER, CONCENTRATION, pah19list),
            hasoriginal = any(PARAMETER == 'TOTAL PAH19-O'),
            original = sum(if_else(PARAMETER == 'TOTAL PAH19-O',
                                   CONCENTRATION,0)),
            difference = PAH19-original,
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(original = if_else(hasoriginal, original, NA_real_),
         difference = if_else(hasoriginal, difference, NA_real_)) %>%
  select ( - hasoriginal)
tst

```
```{r}
mean(tst$difference, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(tst$difference, na.rm=TRUE)
max(tst$difference, na.rm=TRUE)
min(tst$difference, na.rm=TRUE)
```
So, our totals are not quite the same. They are, on average, slightly lower, but
not consistently so.  Occasionally, differences are very large. Not good....

Analysis of the other PAH totals (PAH24, PAH40) show similar differences between
original reported totals, and the totals we calculated.  We are unable to
resolve those differences, which probably relate to the exact compounds added
for each sample.

# Warnings about Missing Parameters for PAH19
The warnings produced by our helper function help identify data inconsistnecies.
IN particular, they highlight differences among samples in the way they handle
the following parameters:  
*  BENZO(B)FLUORANTHENE
*	 BENZO(K)FLUORANTHENE
*  DIBENZOTHIOPHENE

The thiophenes are not measured in all samples.

Handling of the Benzoflouranthenes differs because BENZO(B)FLUORANTHENE,
BENZO(j)FLUORANTHENE and BENZO(K)FLUORANTHENE are chemically quite similar. They
are often reported as a sum, under a variety of conventions, including:

```{r}
BenzoFs <- SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(PARAMETER, Class) %>%
  filter(Class == 'PAH') %>%
  filter(grepl('BENZO', PARAMETER)) %>%
  filter(grepl('FLUORANTHENE', PARAMETER)) %>%
  unique()  %>% pull(PARAMETER)
(BenzoFs <- BenzoFs[-2])   # remove a spurious match
```
# How are Benzoflouranthenes Reported?
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, `WEIGHT BASIS`,
         `TEST METHOD`, PARAMETER, CONCENTRATION, Class)%>%
  filter (`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  filter(PARAMETER %in% BenzoFs) %>%
  pivot_wider(c(Code, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, `TEST METHOD`),
                names_from = PARAMETER, values_from = CONCENTRATION) %>%
  rename_all(~ c('Code', 'Samp', 'Method', 'BJK', 'None', 'B', 'JK', 'K'))
  
```

The data falls into FOUR categories: 

1.  ONLY BENZO[B,J,K]FLUORANTHENES reported  
2.  ONLY BENZOFLUORANTHENE reported (2006 data) These samples report the same
    `TEST METHOD` as the ones reporting BENZO[B,J,K]FLUORANTHENES, so we suspect
    the terms are synonyms, but can not be certain.
3.  BENZO[J,K]FLUORANTHENES and BENZO(B)FLUORANTHENE reported separately. These 
    samples also report the same `TEST METHOD`.  Sum of the two should be
    similar to the first two categories, except that differences may arise due 
    to treatment of non-detects. Such differences should be small.
4.  Although BENZO(K)FLOURANTHENE was reported above detection limits only once,
    examination of that sample and its field replicates show that for those 
    samples, both BENZO(B)FLOURANTHENE and BENZO(K)FLOURANTHENE were reported, 
    but almost always below detection limits.  These samples use a slightly 
    different `TEST METHOD`.  It is not clear whether the sum of these two
    values is comparable to teh prior three methods or not.

All benzoflouranthenes can be summed, without double counting, but totals
may not be directly comparable, especially for Group (4).  In particular, PAH19
totals (as described in Leblanc et al. 2009) nominally include
BENZO(B)FLUORANTHENE and BENZO(K)FLUORANTHENE, but not BENZO(J)FLUORANTHENE.

We include all of these near-synonyms in our list of parameters to sum to 
produce  PAH19, PAH24, and PAH40 totals.  This appears appropriate since 
different samples do not "mix and match" how results were reported.

**Done.**

## Relatioship between Totals and benzoflouranthenes
Lets see what totals are reported with each pattern.
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, `WEIGHT BASIS`,
         PARAMETER, CONCENTRATION, Class)%>%
  filter (`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  filter(PARAMETER %in% BenzoFs | grepl('TOTAL*.PAH', PARAMETER)) %>%
  filter(! (grepl('-H', PARAMETER) | grepl('-D', PARAMETER))) %>%
  pivot_wider(c(Code, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID),
                names_from = PARAMETER, values_from = CONCENTRATION) %>%
  mutate(across(3:11, function(X) as.integer(X>0))) %>%
  select(-`BENZO(B)FLUORANTHENE`, -BENZOFLUORANTHENE) %>%
  group_by(`BENZO[B,J,K]FLUORANTHENES`, `BENZO[J,K]FLUORANTHENES`, `BENZO(K)FLUORANTHENE`) %>%
  summarize(across(3:6, sum, na.rm=TRUE), .groups = 'keep')
```

*  BENZO[BJK]FLOURANTHENES are reported as TOTAL PAH19 ALWAYS(?) other TOTAL PAH
   values sometimes.  
*  BENZO[J,K]FLUORANTHENES and BENZO[B]FLUORANTHENES are reported with TOTALs  
*  BENZOFLOURANTHENE was NEVER reported with  TOTALs  
*  BENZO(K)FLOURANTHENE was NEVER reported with TOTALs  


# "C-" Totals
Other Totals and Calculated values follow standard practice.  These include all
the values prefaced by "C1-", "C2-", "C3-", and "C4-" except the diagnostic
ratios treated next.

The number following the C represents the number of alkyl carbons added to a
basic PAH structure. Many of these categories originated in the uncertainty of
separating chemically similar compounds using certain (often older) analytic
methods.  More recently, with methods better able to differentiate among these
compounds, the totals may be calculated, as apparently they are here.

```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, `TEST METHOD`, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, `WEIGHT BASIS`,
         PARAMETER, CONCENTRATION, Class)%>%
  filter (`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  filter(grepl('C[1-9]-', PARAMETER)) %>%    # C functions
  filter(! grepl('/', PARAMETER)) %>%       # Not c ratios
  pivot_wider(names_from = Class, values_from = CONCENTRATION) %>%
  select( -ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, -`WEIGHT BASIS`)
```
We have not yet been able to determine for sure which individual PAHs are summed
to produce each of these calaulated totals.

# Diagnotic Ratios
Some of these PARAMETERS are diagnostic RATIOS, not totals.  These ratios are
useful for determining the likely sources of the PAH mixtures.  Such
"fingerprinting"  is not a priority for the 2020 State of the Bay report.

Here is a list of the diagnostic ratios reported:
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(Code, `TEST METHOD`, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, `WEIGHT BASIS`,
         PARAMETER, CONCENTRATION, Class)%>%
  filter (`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  filter(grepl('C[1-9]-.*?/', PARAMETER)) %>%
  group_by(PARAMETER) %>%
  summarize (Name = first( PARAMETER), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  pull(Name)
```


# Next Steps
In the absence of certainty about how totals were calculated, we are not in a
position to recalculate totals either for basic QA/QC checks or to use more
modern statistical methods for handling non-detects.  We are forced to rely on
the diagnostic totals calculated by DEP.
