# Introduction
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.

Unfortunately, the data delivery contains little metadata, so it takes some
effort to understand the data format and analyze it correctly. Among other
problems, we need to understand dates and locations of samples, what analytes
were used for different samples, etc.

In this notebook we construct a code that uniquely identifies separate sampling
events (dates, sites, locations and field replicates).


# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(htmltools)  # used by knitr called here only to avoid startup text later in document
library(knitr)
```
# Load Data
```{r folder_refs}
auntfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
grandparent <- dirname(parent)
aunt  <- file.path(grandparent,auntfldnm)
fn <- 'CascoBaySWATtissue_Bohlen.xlsx'
```

## Copy Data
This is a larger data file that takes some time to load.  Getting the column
types right dramatically improves load speed. Much of the data is qualitative,
and can't be handled in R.
```{r copy_data}
SWAT_data <- read_excel(file.path(aunt, fn), 
    sheet = "Mussels Data", col_types = c("numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text"))

before <- nrow(SWAT_data)
```

## Remove duplicates
Many samples -- nearly 20% -- are members of a group of duplicates.  We can
think of no valid reason why two records should be exact duplicates in this
setting, so we remove all duplicates using the unique() function.

```{r}
SWAT_data <- unique(SWAT_data)
```

# Creating a Unique ID for Sampling Events
Ideally, we want to be able to uniquely identify samples, so we know when and
where each sample was collected, and what data is associated with a single
sampling event.  It appears that the most likely data field to convey that
information is the "SAMPLE_ID" field.  If that is correct, it should correspond
to unique combinations of some, or most of:

*  `SITE SEQ` / `EGAD_SITE_NAME`
*  `CURRENT_SAMPLE_POINT_NAME`
*  `SAMPLE POINT TYPE`
*  `SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD`
*  `SAMPLE TYPE`
*  `SAMPLE_DATE`

We can test that as follows:

```{r}
SWAT_data %>%
  group_by(SAMPLE_ID) %>%
  summarize(nsites    = length(unique(`SITE SEQ`)),
            nsamppt   = length(unique(`CURRENT_SAMPLE_POINT_NAME`)),
            npttypes  = length(unique(`SAMPLE POINT TYPE`)),
            nmeth     = length(unique(`SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD`)),
            nsamptype  = length(unique(`SAMPLE TYPE`)),
            ndates    = length(unique(`SAMPLE_DATE`)),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  summarize_at(vars(nsites:ndates), max)

```

From that we can see that SAMPLE_ID is tied to unique  

*  `SITE SEQ` / `CURRENT_SITE_NAME` / `Code`  
*  `CURRENT_SAMPLE_POINT_NAME`  
*  `SAMPLE POINT TYPE`  

But NOT to unique  

*  `SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD`  
*  `SAMPLE TYPE`  
*  `SAMPLE_DATE`  

It is possible that multiple sample types might be collected during a single
site visit, with each sent off to different laboratories (for example).  So the
most troubling of these is the date.  We next check if the combination of
SAMPLE_ID and SAMPLE_DATE provides unique information.

## What Timestep Provides Unique Sample Identifiers
It would be nice to be able to make a unique sample ID code that does not depend
on the full date.  We know we have multiple samples collected at single sites in
a few years, but I don't know if they had the same SAMPLE_ID.
 
```{r}
SWAT_data %>%
  group_by (SAMPLE_ID,SAMPLE_DATE) %>%
  summarize(SAMPLE_ID = first(SAMPLE_ID),
            SAMPLE_DATE = first(SAMPLE_DATE),
            year  = as.numeric(format(SAMPLE_DATE, '%Y')),
            month = as.numeric(format(SAMPLE_DATE, '%m')),
            day = as.numeric(format(SAMPLE_DATE, '%d')),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  # Count SAMPLE_ID on each day (they are unique)
  group_by (SAMPLE_ID, year, month, day) %>%
  mutate   (Ddates = sum(! is.na(SAMPLE_DATE))) %>%
  ungroup  () %>% 
  # Count SAMPLE_ID by month -- and keep the highest daily total
  group_by (SAMPLE_ID, year, month) %>%
  mutate   (maxDdates = max(Ddates),
            Mdates = sum(! is.na(SAMPLE_DATE))) %>%
  select(-Ddates) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # Count SAMPLE_ID by year -- and keep the highest daily and monthly totals
  group_by(SAMPLE_ID, year) %>%
  mutate(maxDdates = max(maxDdates),
         maxMdates = max(Mdates),
         Ydates = sum(! is.na(SAMPLE_DATE))) %>%
  select (-Mdates) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # Roll results up into a single row tibble
  summarize(maxDdates = max(maxDdates),
            maxMdates = max(maxMdates),
            maxYdates = max(Ydates),
            .groups = 'drop')
```

## Demonstrate The Logic
That shows that SAMPLE_ID is not unique within years, or even within years and
months.  To get to a unique combination, we must include the day as well.  On
the other hand, we never have more than two sample dates at any SAMPLE_ID in a
year.  If we could figure out which is which, we could use the year and a
sequence number as a unique ID.

But it turns out, we can do better, and make the year and date codes consistent
across all samples collected in a given year. We never see more than a few
sample dates within a year (at all locations), so we can code each sample date
as a year plus a digit.

A slightly roundabout way to convert from dates to sequence of numbers is to use
as.numeric(factor(.)).

Here's the logic, looking only as SAMPLE_ID_and DATES
```{r}
tmp <- SWAT_data %>%
  group_by  (SAMPLE_ID,SAMPLE_DATE) %>%
  summarize (SAMPLE_ID = first(SAMPLE_ID),
             SAMPLE_DATE = first(SAMPLE_DATE),
             .groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate    (Year  = as.numeric(format(SAMPLE_DATE, '%Y'))) %>%
  mutate    (sample_id = gsub(" ", "_", SAMPLE_ID)) %>%
  group_by  (Year) %>%
  mutate    (tag = as.numeric(factor(SAMPLE_DATE))) %>%
  ungroup   ()  %>%
  mutate    (code = paste(sample_id, Year, tag, sep = '_')) %>%
  select    (-sample_id) %>%
  arrange(Year, SAMPLE_ID)
tmp
```
So, other than really ugly unique sample identifiers, we've produced a useful solution.

### A Quick Test
Confirm that we now have unique codes:
```{r}
tmp %>% group_by(code) %>%
  summarize(n = length(unique(SAMPLE_ID,SAMPLE_DATE)),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  summarize(maxtimes = max(n))
```

## Calculate Unique Sample Codes and Simplify the Data
Now, we can add that logic (and our earlier lessons about uninformative data
codes) to the original data set.
```{r}
SWAT_simplified <- SWAT_data %>%
  # Eliminate uninformative identifiers
  select    (-`SAMPLE TYPE`, -`SAMPLE POINT TYPE`, -`SAMPLE LOCATION`,
             -`RESULT TYPE`, -`PARAMETER_QUALIFIER`, -`PARAMETER FILTERED`,
             -`SAMPLE FILTER`, -`DEPTH`, -`DEPTH UNITS`,
             -TREATMENT, -`METER_CALIBRATED`) %>%
  
  # Eliminate data we will not analyze
  select    (-SITE_DESCRIPTION, -ANALYSIS_DATE,
             -`QC TYPE`, -SAMPLED_BY, -`UNITS DESCRIPTION`,
             -`SAMPLE COMMENT`, -`LAB COMMENT`, -`VALIDATION COMMENT`) %>%
  
  # Create Site Code and Site Name
  mutate    (SiteCode =  first(sub('.* - ','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`)), 
             Site =  first(sub(' - .*','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`))) %>%
  select(-EGAD_SITE_NAME) %>%
  
  # Create Year Time Stamp and (Draft 1) Unique Sample ID
  mutate    (Year  = as.numeric(format(SAMPLE_DATE, '%Y')),
             sample_id = gsub(" ", "_", SAMPLE_ID)) %>%
  group_by  (Year) %>%
  mutate    (tag = as.numeric(factor(SAMPLE_DATE))) %>%
  ungroup   ()  %>%
  mutate    (Code = paste(sample_id, Year, tag, sep = '_')) %>%
  select    (-sample_id, -tag) %>%
  select(`SITE SEQ`, SiteCode, Site, Year, SAMPLE_DATE, SAMPLE_ID, Code, everything())
SWAT_simplified
```

### Check Uniqueness
```{r}
SWAT_simplified %>%
  select(c(SiteCode, CURRENT_SAMPLE_POINT_NAME,
           `SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD`,
           SAMPLE_DATE, `TEST METHOD`, Code)) %>%
  group_by(Code) %>%
  summarize(nsites    = length(unique(`SiteCode`)),
            ndates    = length(unique(`SAMPLE_DATE`)),
            nsamppt   = length(unique(`CURRENT_SAMPLE_POINT_NAME`)),
            nmeth     = length(unique(`SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD`)),
            .groups = 'drop')
```
So, that works -- Each code has only one site, date and sample_ID.  Some of
those codes are annoyingly long, because they are constructed from long
subcomponents, but they are unique....
