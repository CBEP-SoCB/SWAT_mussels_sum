# Introduction
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.

Unfortunately, the data delivery contains little metadata, so it takes some
effort to understand the data format and analyze it correctly.

In this Notebook we review the structure of the data to determine which data
columns contain useful information, and derive rules for working with the data.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(htmltools)  # used by knitr called here only to avoid startup text later in document
library(knitr)
```

# Load Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
auntfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
grandparent <- dirname(parent)
aunt  <- file.path(grandparent,auntfldnm)
fn <- 'CascoBaySWATtissue_Bohlen.xlsx'
```

## Copy Data
This is a larger data file that takes some time to load.  Getting the column
types right dramatically improves load speed. Much of the data is qualitative,
and can't be handled in R.

```{r copy_data}
SWAT_data <- read_excel(file.path(aunt, fn),
    sheet = "Mussels Data", col_types = c("numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text"))

before <- nrow(SWAT_data)
```

## Remove duplicates
Many samples -- nearly 20% -- are members of a group of duplicates.  We can
think of no valid reason why two records should be exact duplicates in this
setting, so we remove all duplicates using the unique() function.

## How many duplicates?
Let's generate a data subset including all complete duplicates, and evaluate its
size.
```{r count_duplicates}
dups <- SWAT_data[duplicated(SWAT_data),]
cat(round(nrow(dups)/nrow(SWAT_data) * 100,1),
    " percent of observations are duplicates.")
rm(dups)
```

## Remove all Complete Duplicate Data Rows
```{r remove_duplicates}
SWAT_data <- unique(SWAT_data)
```

```{r percent_retained}
(after <- nrow(SWAT_data))
cat('We retained ', round(after/before,3)*100,
    ' percent of rows in the original data.')
```

# Exploration of Data Codes
## Uninformative Codes
### What is `Sample_ID`
The SAMPLE_ID itself appears to be a combination of other information, including
* A site Code
* A current sample point name, and
* Sometimes a YEAR
* Sometimes a method qualifier, like "DIOXIN"

That "DIOXIN" qualifier is unique to "MEPH" samples, which, based on the
similarity of the site codes used,  appear to be 2003 Gulfwatch samples. Data
post 2000 are not available online through the Gulfwatch website.  In the EGAD
data, they are associated with the  "FORE RIVER OUTER" location.

```{r example_sample_id}
SWAT_data %>%
  filter(grepl('DIOXIN', SAMPLE_ID)) %>%
         select(SAMPLE_ID, EGAD_SITE_NAME) %>%
         unique() %>% arrange(SAMPLE_ID)
```
So, SAMPLE_ID combines a LOT of info that is mostly also contained in other
data.  Unfortunately, as we will see below, it is NOT a unique sample
identifier.

### What is `SAMPLE TYPE`
```{r sample_type}
unique(SWAT_data$`SAMPLE TYPE`)
```

```{r sample_type_crosstab}
as.data.frame(xtabs(~PARAMETER + `SAMPLE TYPE` , data = SWAT_data)) %>%
  filter(SAMPLE.TYPE == 	'PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTIC' & Freq > 0)
```
So the ONLY parameter ever included under 'PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTIC' is the
species of shellfish sampled.  Thus "SAMPLE TYPES"  conveys no independent
information, and so is of little use.

### What is `SAMPLE POINT TYPE`?
```{r sample_point)type}
unique(SWAT_data$`SAMPLE POINT TYPE`)

```
`SAMPLE POINT TYPE` contains only a single value so it is useless.  

### What is `SAMPLE LOCATION`?
```{r sample_location}
unique(SWAT_data$`SAMPLE LOCATION`)
```
Again, no useful information here.

### What is `RESULT TYPE`?
```{r result_type}
unique(SWAT_data$`RESULT TYPE`)
```

```{r parameters_with_phys_meas}
SWAT_data %>%
  select(`RESULT TYPE`, PARAMETER) %>%
  filter(`RESULT TYPE`=="PHYSICAL MEASUREMENT") %>%
  select (-`RESULT TYPE`) %>%
  unique()
```
So that is uninformative too.  It mirrors SAMPLE TYPE. The only item ever
flagged as a "PHYSICAL MEASUREMENT" is is the species of shellfish.

### What is `PARAMETER_QUALIFIER`?
```{r parameter_qualifier}
unique(SWAT_data$`PARAMETER_QUALIFIER`)
```
This does not appear to be informative, but we learn later that there are some
places where this column is the ONLY difference between what are otherwise
apparently identical data rows.

### What are `PARAMETER FILTERED` and `SAMPLE FILTER`?
```{r filtered}
xtabs(~ `PARAMETER FILTERED` + `SAMPLE FILTER`, data = SWAT_data, addNA = TRUE)
```
SO both are uninformative. Of course, tissue samples are not filtered.

### What are `DEPTH` and `DEPTH UNITS`?
```{r depth}
xtabs( ~ DEPTH + `DEPTH UNITS`, data = SWAT_data, addNA = TRUE)
```
Samples were picked up from the shore, so depth is irrelevant.

### What is `TREATMENT`?
```{r treatment}
unique(SWAT_data$`TREATMENT`)
```
These are observational data.

### What is `METER_CALIBRATED`?
```{r meter}
unique(SWAT_data$`METER_CALIBRATED`)
```
Samples were collected, and the data provided to us does not include any
*in situ* ancillary data like temperature or dissolved oxygen, so no data was
collected with instruments that require calibration in the field.

## Possibly Informative Codes
### What is `CURRENT_SAMPLE_POINT_NAME`?
```{r sample_point_name}
as.tibble(xtabs(~SWAT_data$`CURRENT_SAMPLE_POINT_NAME`, addNA = TRUE)) %>%
  rename_at(c(1), ~'SPoint1')
```
These names are meaningful, but difficult to use.  They are used consistently to
distinguish among samples, and are connected to the spatial data, but SAMPLE
POINT names are not unique, and can be duplicated between different sites or
within one Sites in different years.  See the discussion of Sites and spatial
data, below.

### What is `PREP METHOD`?
```{r prep_method}
unique(SWAT_data$`PREP METHOD`)
```
So,potentially useful info, if I knew what the codes mean.  For now, we largely
ignore these details as not relevant for our interpretation of results at this
time.  But we may need to evaluate that assumption later.

### What is `SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD`?
```{r sample_collection_method}
unique(SWAT_data$`SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD`)
```
Although this suggests this Code is valuable, it's not obvious what it means
from internal data alone, or whether it has been applied fully consistently. We
know from other information that some studies (e.g., Gulfwatch) explicitly uses
*composite samples* from twenty *hand picked* mussels.  So both terms appear to
apply.  We dig in a little deeper.

#### Does `SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD` Break Out by Parameter?
```{r collection_method_by_parameter}
xtabs(~PARAMETER + `SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD`, data = SWAT_data) %>%
  as.tibble() %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = PARAMETER,
              names_from = `SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD`,
              values_from = n) %>%
  arrange(`COMPOSITE SAMPLE`, `PARAMETER`)
```
So, other than the fact that many of the pesticide data are derived only from
composite samples, and some PCBs (by chemical name) appear only from 'hand
picked' samples, it appears that these represent different sampling strategies,
or at least different labels for sample collection strategies employed during
sample collection.

Curiously, the species identification '*Mytilus edulis*' is only included in the
'COMPOSITE SAMPLE' category 7 times, MUCH less frequently than some other
parameters.  That appears counter-intuitive. How can we have more samples for
parameters than samples of mussels?

This points not only to problems with how this Code was assigned, but also to
a couple of things will be explored find later:  
1.  Some samples are reported three times, on different weight bases, so we get
    each parameter three times for each physical sample.  
2.  There are some laboratory duplicates, again, representing physical samples
    multiple times.  
3.  Some samples are reported  -- apparently duplicated -- as coming from
    different laboratories or different methods, but with no other differences.
    
Still, it appears this Code is inconsistent.

#### Does `SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD` Break Out by Site?
```{r collection_method_by_site}
xtabs(~EGAD_SITE_NAME + `SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD`, data = SWAT_data) %>%
  as.tibble() %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = EGAD_SITE_NAME,
              names_from = `SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD`,
              values_from = n) %>%
  arrange(`COMPOSITE SAMPLE`)
```
So this ALMOST lines up.  With a few exceptions, all or almost all data from
each site is flagged one way or the other.  

#### Does `SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD` Break Out by Date?
```{r collection_method_by_date}
xtabs(~SAMPLE_DATE + `SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD`, data = SWAT_data) %>%
  as.tibble() %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = SAMPLE_DATE,
              names_from = `SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD`,
              values_from = n)
```
Again, ALMOST all samples from each date are flagged one way or the other.
This suggests there may be some inconsistency with how this Code has been
implied.

#### When is "HAND PICKED" used?
But how can we figure out what these sample collection methods mean?  We know
the Sample_Collection_Method for Gulfwatch was a composite of 20 mussels.
Gulfwatch used the sample code "MEPH" for a site in "Portland Harbor". The
related EGAD_SITE_NAME is 'FORE RIVER OUTER - CBFROR'.

```{r example_collection_method}
SWAT_data %>% filter(EGAD_SITE_NAME== 'FORE RIVER OUTER - CBFROR') %>%
  select(c(2, 13, 7, 4, 8)) %>%
  unique()
```
So this site, which follows the Gulfwatch methods is flagged consistently as "HAND-PICKED".

#### Conclusion -- This is Confusing

This is confusing -- it's not clear what the different sample collection codes
mean.  They clearly segregate to some extent by sample events, but it appears
not entirely.

### What are `LAB QUALIFIER` and `VALIDATION QUALIFIER`?
```{r qualifiers_list}
SWAT_data %>% select(`LAB QUALIFIER`,`VALIDATION QUALIFIER`, `QUALIFIER DESCRIPTION`) %>% unique() %>% kable()
```

So it looks like the second qualifier is a subset of the first.

```{r qualifiers_xtab}
xtabs(~`LAB QUALIFIER` + `VALIDATION QUALIFIER`, data = SWAT_data, addNA = TRUE)
```
Interestingly, relatively few of the Lab Qualifiers were pulled out in the
Validation Qualifiers. Why?

```{r qualifiers_with_data}
SWAT_data %>% 
  select(`LAB QUALIFIER`, `VALIDATION QUALIFIER`, CONCENTRATION, RL, MDL) %>%
  group_by(`LAB QUALIFIER`, `VALIDATION QUALIFIER`) %>%
  summarize(has_data = any(! is.na(CONCENTRATION)),
            all_data = all(! is.na(CONCENTRATION)),
            has_RL   = any(! is.na(RL)),
            all_RL   = all(! is.na(RL)),
            has_MDL  = any(! is.na(MDL)),
            all_MDL  = all(! is.na(MDL))
            )
```
We generally know how to handle the `VALIDATION QUALIFIERS`

*  U codes we treat as right censored.  
*  J codes are estimated values.  We usually include those values in analyses,
   but they may have higher error.  We do not explicitly model that.  Also in
   these data they do not have associated detection limits.  
*  B codes have different meanings for organic and inorganic compounds, but
   generally they include values and and detection limits. 
*  EMPC and B/EMPC are Estimated Maximum Possible Concentrations.  We typically
   will handle these simply as observations, but we might want to treat them 
   as right censored instead, especially if they are abundant.

### What is `WEIGHT BASIS`?
```{r weight_basis}
unique(SWAT_data$`WEIGHT BASIS`)
```
This is explored in detail in a later notebook.

### What is `DILUTION FACTOR`?
```{r dilution}
kable(xtabs(~as.numeric(SWAT_data$`DILUTION_FACTOR`)),
      col.names =c("Dilution", "Frequency"))
```
While this is good to know, it is not clear how we use it in our analyses, as it
is our understanding that the CONCENTRATION values are already adjusted for
dilution.
